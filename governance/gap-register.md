## Ops / Infrastructure Gaps

# RCP-1 — Revenue Domain Completion Plan (Phase 1)

**Anchored:** 2026-03-02  
**Governance Sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-041  
**Reconciliation TECS:** OPS-RCP1-GAP-RECONCILIATION-001  
**Scope:** Tenant Commerce Domain (revenue readiness) across Enterprise + White-label tenants, without shell drift.

## Objective
Complete the minimal revenue-operational loop so that:
- Tenants can sell (catalog present + manageable)
- Buyers can purchase (cart + checkout)
- Orders can be operationally managed (status progression + audit)
- WL_ADMIN and EXPERIENCE shells expose the same *capability set* (not merged planes)
- Governance and audit invariants remain enforced

## Explicit Non-Goals (Hard Stops)
- DOES NOT extend G-020 StateMachineService to ORDER (blocked by schema prerequisite)
- DOES NOT introduce new DB tables, migrations, schema changes, or RLS policy changes
- DOES NOT reopen D-5 (B1) — `app.roles` remains dormant for live requests; no DB-level role gates
- DOES NOT merge WL_ADMIN and EXPERIENCE shells; no cross-shell routing changes that erode appState boundaries
- DOES NOT implement payment gateway / PSP integration
- DOES NOT refactor components "for cleanliness" unless required by revenue correctness

## Canonical Drift Correction
The earlier draft notion of "OPS-ORDER-DOMAIN-STATE-GUARD-001 (lifecycle)" is corrected:
- Phase 1 implements **app-layer order status progression + audit**, not G-020 lifecycle.
- Full ORDER lifecycle state machine wiring requires a separate schema wave (see GAP-ORDER-LC-001).

## RCP-1 — Ordered TECS Sequence (Phase 1)
1. **OPS-ORDER-STATUS-TRANSITIONS-001**
   - Add app-layer guarded order status transitions with audit (no schema, no SM).
2. **OPS-WLADMIN-ORDERS-PANEL-001**
   - Replace WL_ADMIN Orders stub with real orders list + actions; consumes existing tenant APIs + transitions endpoint.
3. **OPS-EXPERIENCE-ORDERS-UX-001**
   - Ensure EXPERIENCE shell order management UX reaches parity with WL_ADMIN (capability parity, not shared plane).
4. **OPS-REVENUE-FLOW-VALIDATION-002**
   - E2E validation with explicit ceiling: PAYMENT_PENDING + app-layer transitions; verify audit trail.

## RCP-1 Commerce Gaps / Work Items (Formal Entries)

| Gap / Work ID | Description | Domain | Severity | Status | Dependencies | Notes / Stop Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GAP-ORDER-LC-001 | ORDER lifecycle schema prerequisite (Future Wave): add ORDER to LifecycleState CHECK constraint; add order lifecycle log table + RLS; seed ORDER states; extend SM EntityType union | Backend / DB | 🔴 HIGH | ✅ **CLOSED** (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-063, 2026-03-03) — B1 ✅ schema foundation; B2/SEED-001 ✅ 4 ORDER transitions seeded; B3/SM-SERVICE-001 ✅ SM enforces ORDER transitions; B4/BACKEND-INTEGRATION-001 ✅ tenant.ts SM-driven; B5/UX-VALIDATION-001 ✅ 22 PASS / 0 FAIL proof; B6a/API-LIFECYCLE-001 ✅ orders enriched with lifecycleState + lifecycleLogs; **B6b/UX-B6B-001 ✅** WLOrdersPanel + EXPOrdersPanel: `deriveStatus()` + audit-log fetch removed; `canonicalStatus(order)` + `LifecycleHistory` component; typecheck EXIT 0; lint EXIT 0. Deferred: orders.status enum extension (ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE CONFIRMED/FULFILLED) — separate migration TECS. | GAP-ORDER-TRANSITIONS-001 (interim app-layer) | B6b complete. GAP-ORDER-LC-001 fully closed. |
| OPS-ORDERS-STATUS-ENUM-001 | `public.order_status` enum extended with CONFIRMED + FULFILLED (CANCELLED verified present — not re-added); deferred from GAP-ORDER-LC-001 B6b; migration `20260315000007_ops_orders_status_enum_001` | DB / Schema | 🟠 MED | ✅ **VALIDATED** (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-070, 2026-03-03) — PREFLIGHT PASS (CANCELLED confirmed); ALTER TYPE x2; VERIFIER PASS (all 5 labels: PAYMENT_PENDING, PLACED, CANCELLED, CONFIRMED, FULFILLED); APPLY_EXIT:0; RESOLVE_EXIT:0; `prisma db pull` minimal diff; typecheck EXIT 0; lint EXIT 0 | GAP-ORDER-LC-001 (deferred item) | Ordered outside transaction — irreversible DDL applied safely with IF NOT EXISTS guard. |
| GAP-ORDER-TRANSITIONS-001 | App-layer order status transitions (Phase 1): PAYMENT_PENDING→CONFIRMED; CONFIRMED→FULFILLED/CANCELLED; OWNER/ADMIN only; audit `order.lifecycle.<state>` | Backend | 🟠 MED | **VALIDATED** — commit `0a03177` (TECS 1) | Existing orders APIs + audit infra | Must not touch G-020 SM. Must not add schema. Must use existing audit_logs. |
| GAP-WL-ORDERS-001 | WL_ADMIN Orders panel: replace WLStubPanel; render orders list + status actions; consume transitions endpoint | Frontend / WL_ADMIN | 🟠 MED | **VALIDATED** — this commit (TECS 2) | GAP-ORDER-TRANSITIONS-001 | Must not merge shells. May reuse presentational components only if shell-local state remains distinct. |
| GAP-EXP-ORDERS-001 | EXPERIENCE Orders UX parity: ensure order list + details + status actions exist and match WL_ADMIN capabilities | Frontend / EXPERIENCE | 🟡 LOW-MED | **VALIDATED** — this commit (TECS 3) | GAP-ORDER-TRANSITIONS-001 | Must not create a second backend path. Use same transition endpoint. |
| GAP-REVENUE-VALIDATE-002 | Revenue flow validation pass: provision → invite → activate → catalog → cart → checkout → order list → status transition → audit verification; ceiling = PAYMENT_PENDING + transitions | QA / Cross-cutting | 🟡 LOW | ✅ **VALIDATED** — TECS 5 complete (Phases 0–5 PASS — 16/16 checks; GOVERNANCE-SYNC-049 — OPS-APPLY-ORDERS-RLS-001, 2026-03-03) | Completion of above TECS | Phases 0–3 PASS (12/21 steps: DB/JWT, catalog create, cart→checkout→PAYMENT_PENDING, orders list + audit). Phases 4–5 unblocked once `rcp1_orders_update_unified_tenant_arm.sql` applied via psql. Re-run Phases 4–5 only: `pnpm -C server exec tsx scripts/validate-rcp1-flow.ts --only-transitions`. Full ceiling: catalog create → cart → checkout → PAYMENT_PENDING → CONFIRMED → FULFILLED / CANCELLED + derivedStatus + audit trail. |
| GAP-RLS-ORDERS-UPDATE-001 | **Orders UPDATE blocked by RLS policy** — `orders_update_unified` policy (FOR UPDATE TO texqtic_app) has USING + WITH CHECK: `current_setting('app.is_admin', true) = 'true'`; withDbContext sets app.org_id/actor_id/realm/request_id + bypass_rls=off, but does NOT set app.is_admin (B1 decision: tenant actor context must not claim admin); row is visible via orders_select_unified (tenant-scoped SELECT) but invisible to UPDATE; privilege grant GRANT UPDATE applied (PG 42501 resolved → P2025 reveals row-policy block) | Backend / DB / RLS | 🔴 HIGH | ✅ **VALIDATED** (ops SQL applied to remote DB — APPLY_EXIT:0, DO-block VERIFY PASS; GOVERNANCE-SYNC-049 — OPS-APPLY-ORDERS-RLS-001, 2026-03-03) | GAP-REVENUE-VALIDATE-002, GAP-ORDER-TRANSITIONS-001 | A1 applied via governed ops SQL: `orders_update_unified` extended with tenant arm `(app.require_org_context() AND tenant_id = app.current_org_id()) OR (current_setting('app.is_admin'::text, true) = 'true'::text)` in both USING + WITH CHECK. Ops file: `server/prisma/ops/rcp1_orders_update_unified_tenant_arm.sql`. Apply: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f server/prisma/ops/rcp1_orders_update_unified_tenant_arm.sql`. Governance sign-off + DO-block verifier embedded in SQL. B1/D-5 posture preserved: no server code changed, `app.is_admin` not set for tenant actors. |

## Linkages to Existing Gaps
- **GAP-RUV-006 (Order lifecycle audit)** remains the canonical record:
  - Current: audit-only lifecycle entry at checkout (PAYMENT_PENDING)
  - Full lifecycle (G-020 style) is blocked until **GAP-ORDER-LC-001**
  - RCP-1 Phase 1 proceeds via **GAP-ORDER-TRANSITIONS-001** (app-layer transitions + audit) without schema changes.

---

## RCP-1 Phase 1 — Closeout (Revenue Domain Completion)

**Scope boundary (unchanged):** RCP-1 Phase 1 validates the Revenue Domain loop up to the ceiling of Order creation at PAYMENT_PENDING plus app-layer operational status actions (TECS 1), without schema migrations, RLS posture changes, lifecycle/G-020 integration, payment gateway work, or shell merges.

### Execution Ledger (Final)

| TECS | Work Item | Gap | Status | Commit |
|------|-----------|-----|--------|--------|
| TECS 1 | OPS-ORDER-STATUS-TRANSITIONS-001 | GAP-ORDER-TRANSITIONS-001 | ✅ VALIDATED | `0a03177` |

| TECS 3 | OPS-EXPERIENCE-ORDERS-UX-001 | GAP-EXP-ORDERS-001 | ✅ VALIDATED | `0c0535d` |
| TECS 4 | OPS-REVENUE-FLOW-VALIDATION-002 | GAP-REVENUE-VALIDATE-002 | ✅ VALIDATED | `b074fe1` (Phases 0–3) · OPS-RLS-ORDERS-UPDATE-001 ops SQL (Phases 4–5 unblocked, GOVERNANCE-SYNC-045) |

### What Is Validated End-to-End (Evidence-Backed)

Phases 0–3 PASS:
- Provision / Invite / Activate (JWT issuance and tenant-realm access) ✅
- Catalog create ✅
- Cart → Checkout ✅
- Order creation at checkout: PAYMENT_PENDING ✅
- Orders list and audit visibility ✅ (WL_ADMIN + EXPERIENCE)

### What Remains Blocked (Root-Cause Isolated — NOW RESOLVED)

Phases 4–5 were previously failing due to `orders_update_unified` RLS policy gating.
**RESOLVED via GOVERNANCE-SYNC-045 / OPS-RLS-ORDERS-UPDATE-001:**
- Governed ops SQL file `server/prisma/ops/rcp1_orders_update_unified_tenant_arm.sql` adds tenant arm to `orders_update_unified`.
- Governance sign-off embedded in SQL header. B1/D-5 posture preserved (no server code changed).
- Apply: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f server/prisma/ops/rcp1_orders_update_unified_tenant_arm.sql`
- Re-run Phases 4–5: `pnpm -C server exec tsx scripts/validate-rcp1-flow.ts --only-transitions`

### Artifacts Produced (Auditable)

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| TECS 4 evidence report | `docs/rcp1/OPS-REVENUE-FLOW-VALIDATION-002.md` | Phases, results, blocker analysis, future-wave SQL proposal |
| Live evidence script | `server/scripts/validate-rcp1-flow.ts` | 21-step proof run with HTTP assertions + JWT minting |
| DB privilege ops file | `server/prisma/ops/rcp1_orders_update_grant.sql` | Auditable GRANT UPDATE (non-migration) |
| RLS ops file (NEW) | `server/prisma/ops/rcp1_orders_update_unified_tenant_arm.sql` | Governed DROP/CREATE for `orders_update_unified` with tenant arm; governance sign-off + DO-block verifier embedded (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-045) |
| Gap register | `governance/gap-register.md` | GOVERNANCE-SYNC-044 + GOVERNANCE-SYNC-045 + status updates |

### Deferred Action (RESOLVED — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-045)

**OPS-RLS-ORDERS-UPDATE-001 implemented.** Governed SQL ops file created and committed:
```sql
-- server/prisma/ops/rcp1_orders_update_unified_tenant_arm.sql
CREATE POLICY orders_update_unified ON public.orders
  AS PERMISSIVE FOR UPDATE TO texqtic_app
  USING (
    (app.require_org_context() AND tenant_id = app.current_org_id())
    OR (current_setting('app.is_admin'::text, true) = 'true'::text)
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    (app.require_org_context() AND tenant_id = app.current_org_id())
    OR (current_setting('app.is_admin'::text, true) = 'true'::text)
  );
```
Apply to DB: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f server/prisma/ops/rcp1_orders_update_unified_tenant_arm.sql`

Then re-run Phases 4–5: `pnpm -C server exec tsx scripts/validate-rcp1-flow.ts --only-transitions`

### Executive Close

RCP-1 Phase 1 is functionally complete and drift-neutral: revenue loop executes through checkout and order visibility across shells; remaining status-action validation is blocked only by DB RLS update gating and is isolated into a post-RCP-1 governed change (GAP-RLS-ORDERS-UPDATE-001).

# Role Model + RLS Vocabulary Anchor (2026-03-01)

> This section is a permanent planning anchor — do not rewrite; append updates as addenda.

## 1. Agreed 3-Role Model — Stable Contract

### Tenant Admin (Org Admin)
- **Scope:** Single org/tenant. All DB reads and writes are RLS-scoped to one `tenant_id` via `app.org_id`.
- **Identity:** Real tenant user; `memberships` row exists with `MembershipRole` in (OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER). JWT carries `userId` + `tenantId`.
- **DB context:** `withDbContext` → `app.org_id = <tenantId>`, `app.actor_id = <userId>`, `app.realm = 'tenant'`, `app.bypass_rls = 'off'`. `app.is_admin` is NOT set.
- **RLS enforcement:** `tenant_id = current_setting('app.org_id', true)` arm in all PERMISSIVE policies.
- **Note (current gap → RESOLVED B1):** `MembershipRole` stored in DB and on `request.userRole` but NEVER flows into DB GUC `app.roles`. RLS treats all tenant users identically. Role boundary is app-layer only. See decision point D-5 in gap list below.
- **Architectural decision (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-036 / 2026-03-02):** `app.roles` GUC is intentionally dormant for live requests. The plumbing exists (`withDbContext` sets it when `context.roles` is provided) but `buildContextFromRequest` does not populate `context.roles` for production requests. This is a deliberate choice — the app-layer chain (JWT verify → `getUserMembership()` → `request.userRole` → route guard) is already fail-closed and no currently-open threat model requires a redundant DB-level role gate. **B2 re-entry condition:** revisit only if (a) a new write path is added that a `MEMBER`/`VIEWER` could reach at the DB layer without passing through the app-layer role guard, AND (b) the attack surface cannot be closed by tightening the app-layer guard alone.

### Platform Admin (Control Plane Operator)
- **Scope:** Cross-tenant bounded reads and writes (support, compliance, finance ops). Cross-tenant only where RLS explicitly permits via `app.is_admin = 'true'`.
- **Identity:** Admin principal; `admin_users` row with `AdminRole` in (SUPER_ADMIN, SUPPORT, ANALYST). JWT carries `adminId` + `role`. Middleware: `adminAuthMiddleware` → `request.isAdmin = true`, `request.adminId`, `request.adminRole`.
- **DB context:** `withAdminContext` → sentinel `orgId = actorId = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'`, `realm = 'control'`, then `app.is_admin = 'true'`. Context: `buildContextFromRequest` is NOT used for admin routes (would fail-closed on missing `orgId`).
- **RLS enforcement:** `current_setting('app.is_admin', true) = 'true'` arm in PERMISSIVE policies + RESTRICTIVE guard admin arm.
- **Capability flag:** `app.is_admin` is the current runtime capability flag for platform admin identity.

### Superadmin (Platform Controller / Orchestrator) — FUTURE FLAG
- **Scope:** All operations including privileged overrides (e.g., force-void, cross-tenant destructive actions). Must be explicit and audited; never accidental.
- **Identity:** `AdminRole.SUPER_ADMIN` exists in DB enum (schema.prisma line 999) and seeded. `requireAdminRole('SUPER_ADMIN')` helper exported from `auth.ts` line 90. Currently zero runtime differentiation from Platform Admin at DB/RLS level.
- **DB context (GUC plumbing complete):** `app.is_superadmin = 'true'` GUC set by `withSuperAdminContext` (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-033). **Zero RLS policies currently consume this GUC** — confirmed by full migration grep with 0 policy matches.
- **Required:** Add `is_superadmin='true'` arms to INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies on `impersonation_sessions` + escalation UPDATE. See `docs/security/SUPERADMIN-RLS-PLAN.md` (OPS-RLS-SUPERADMIN-001-DISCOVERY-001, GOVERNANCE-SYNC-071).

> ✅ Fixed 2026-03-01 via OPS-RLS-ADMIN-REALM-001. `app.require_admin_context()` now checks `realm='control'` + `is_admin='true'` + `actor_id NOT NULL`. impersonation_sessions RLS is no longer dead-code.

### The Mismatch
| Layer | Value set | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `withAdminContext` (TypeScript) | `realm = 'control'` | `database-context.ts` line ~590; `DatabaseContext` union type = `'tenant' \| 'control'` |
| `app.current_realm()` SQL function comment | values: `'tenant'` or `'control'` | Gate-A migration comment |
| `app.require_admin_context()` | checks `current_realm() = 'admin'` | Gate-D7 migration line 17 |
| **Result** | `require_admin_context()` is **always FALSE** in production | Dead function |

### Impact
Any policy that uses `app.require_admin_context()` as a predicate is permanently fail-closed (always blocks) for all production admin operations:
- `impersonation_sessions` SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE unified policies: all fail-closed → impersonation cannot function under RLS.
- These tables survive today only because the service (`impersonation.service.ts`) uses raw `prisma.$transaction` without `SET LOCAL ROLE texqtic_app`, bypassing RLS as the postgres superuser (`BYPASSRLS`). This is security debt, not correctness.

### Long-term Vocabulary Principle
- `app.realm` is a **plane identifier** only. Values: `tenant`, `control`, `system`, `test`. Do NOT use realm to grant privileges.
- Platform admin capability → explicit flag: `app.is_admin = 'true'` (current) → `app.is_platform_admin = 'true'` (future rename, controlled TECS).
- Superadmin capability → separate flag: `app.is_superadmin = 'true'` (future).
- Never use `realm = 'admin'`; the admin plane IS the control plane (`realm = 'control'`).

### Safe Remediation Path
- **Short term (Wave 3 tail — P0):** Fix `app.require_admin_context()` DB function to treat `realm IN ('control')` as admin-capable, OR retire the function and key off `app.is_admin = 'true'` + `actor_id NOT NULL` directly. Either path resolves the dead-function gap.
- **Medium term:** If `app.is_admin` is renamed to `app.is_platform_admin`, do so via a single controlled TECS with a migration covering all policy references in one transaction.

## 3. audit_logs Mixed Policy State — Decision: Option B

**Current state (as of 2026-03-01):**
- `rls.sql` creates `audit_logs_tenant_read` (PERMISSIVE SELECT).
- Migration `20260304000000_gatetest003_audit_logs_admin_select` creates `audit_logs_admin_select` (PERMISSIVE SELECT, `tenant_id IS NULL` only) + extends `audit_logs_guard` RESTRICTIVE with admin arm.
- Gatetest003 verifier DO block expects `audit_logs_select_unified` + `audit_logs_admin_select` = exactly 2 SELECT policies. If `audit_logs_tenant_read` was never dropped, count = 3 → verifier FAIL.

### Option A — Drop audit_logs_admin_select; rely on existing unified tenant policy
**Pros:** Fastest. Minimal SQL touch if unified already has admin arm.
**Cons:**
- If remaining unified policy is tenant-only, platform admin loses cross-tenant audit visibility.
- Does not fix naming drift (`audit_logs_tenant_read` vs expected `audit_logs_select_unified`).
- Higher regression risk: removing known admin gate without confirming remaining policy covers admin arm.
- **Only safe if** live `pg_policies.qual` for the remaining SELECT policy explicitly includes `OR current_setting('app.is_admin', true) = 'true'`.

### Option B — Single unified SELECT policy with tenant OR admin arm; remove extra admin policy ✅ CHOSEN
**Pros:**
- Cleanest structure: one PERMISSIVE SELECT for `texqtic_app`.
- Explicitly enforces cross-tenant admin reads through `app.is_admin`.
- Removes naming drift; establishes canonical policy name `audit_logs_select_unified`.
- Future-proof: add `OR current_setting('app.is_superadmin', true) = 'true'` arm without creating new policies.

**Required reconciliation steps for Option B:**
1. Drop `audit_logs_tenant_read` (rls.sql name) and `audit_logs_admin_select`.
2. Create `audit_logs_select_unified` with qual:
   - `(org_id IS NOT NULL AND tenant_id::text = current_setting('app.org_id', true))` — tenant arm
   - `OR current_setting('app.is_admin', true) = 'true'` — platform admin arm (cross-tenant, NO `tenant_id IS NULL` restriction — see key semantic decision below)
3. Confirm gatetest003-equivalent verifier count = 1 (unified) + verify RESTRICTIVE guard unchanged.

**Key semantic decision recorded:** Platform admin cross-tenant audit reads SHOULD include tenant-scoped rows (not only `tenant_id IS NULL`). Rationale: admin investigation requires reading "what did tenant X do?" The `tenant_id IS NULL` restriction in `audit_logs_admin_select` was a conservative first pass; Option B removes it. Mandatory compensating control: all control-plane read endpoints that query `audit_logs` MUST log via `writeAuditLog` (see D-3 gap, and TECS item below).

**Decision:** Option B. Record: "audit_logs SELECT consolidation → single `audit_logs_select_unified` policy; admin arm without `tenant_id IS NULL` restriction; mandatory read-audit logging on all control-plane GET /audit-logs handlers."

## 4. Gap List — Wave 3 Tail Specific Gaps

| ID | Gap | Severity | First identified |
|----|-----|---------|-----------------|
| D-1 | `app.require_admin_context()` always returns FALSE in production; `realm = 'admin'` never set; impersonation RLS dead-code | **CRITICAL** | 2026-03-01 investigation |
| D-2A | `AdminRole.SUPER_ADMIN` — capability plumbing: zero runtime GUC differentiation from other admin roles | **VALIDATED — OPS-SUPERADMIN-CAPABILITY-001 / GOVERNANCE-SYNC-033** (plumbing only: `withSuperAdminContext` + `app.is_superadmin` GUC set; proof endpoint `/whoami` verified) | 2026-03-01 investigation |
| D-2B | `AdminRole.SUPER_ADMIN` — capability enforcement: no route-level OR DB-level guard prevents SUPPORT/ANALYST from reaching SUPER_ADMIN-only surfaces | **VALIDATED — OPS-SUPERADMIN-ENFORCEMENT-001 / GOVERNANCE-SYNC-034** (`requireAdminRole('SUPER_ADMIN')` preHandler on 5 surfaces; tenant provision audit gap also closed) | 2026-03-01 investigation |
| D-3 | All admin READ endpoints (`GET /api/control/*`) are unlogged — no `writeAuditLog` call on any of 9 GET handlers | **VALIDATED — OPS-CONTROL-READ-AUDIT-001 / GOVERNANCE-SYNC-032** | 2026-03-01 investigation |
| D-4 | `impersonation.service` uses raw `prisma.$transaction` without `SET LOCAL ROLE texqtic_app` — operates as postgres BYPASSRLS superuser; RLS not enforced for impersonation writes | **VALIDATED (BYPASSRLS path removed) — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-028** | 2026-03-01 investigation |
| D-5 | `MembershipRole` (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER/VIEWER) never flows to `app.roles` GUC; RLS treats all tenant users identically — role boundary is app-layer only. **Decision B1:** DB role-agnostic by design; `app.roles` intentionally never activated for live requests; role enforcement is app-layer only (JWT → membership lookup → `request.userRole` → route guard). B2 re-entry condition documented in Role Model section above. | **RESOLVED (B1 — app-layer only)** | 2026-03-01 investigation; resolved 2026-03-02 GOVERNANCE-SYNC-036 |
| D-6 | `audit_logs` mixed policy naming: `audit_logs_tenant_read` (rls.sql) coexists with gatetest003 expectation of `audit_logs_select_unified`; verifier may fail depending on apply order | **VALIDATED — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-029** | 2026-03-01 investigation |
| D-7 | `audit_logs_admin_select` restricts admin reads to `tenant_id IS NULL` rows only — blocks cross-tenant investigation reads | **VALIDATED — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-029** | 2026-03-01 investigation (resolved by Option B above) |
| D-8 | `withDbContext` sets `bypass_rls = 'off'` but does NOT explicitly reset `app.is_admin`; pooler theoretically could bleed `is_admin='true'` from prior tx (mitigated by SET LOCAL semantics) | **LOW** | 2026-03-01 investigation |

## 5. Wave 3 Tail — Priority Ladder (No-Drift Execution Order)

Established 2026-03-01. Must not be reordered without a new governance anchor.

```
P0 — OPS-RLS-ADMIN-REALM-001
     Fix require_admin_context() dead function (D-1)
     Blocks: impersonation RLS correctness; D-4 fix pre-req
     Direction: keep realm='control'; update DB function to check
                realm IN ('control') instead of realm = 'admin',
                OR remove realm check entirely and key off
                app.is_admin + actor_id NOT NULL
     → MUST complete before Wave 3.1+ RLS consolidation resumes

P1 — G-006C-AUDIT-LOGS-UNIFY-001
     Resolve audit_logs mixed state using Option B (D-6, D-7)
     + add control-plane read-audit logging (D-3)
     Targets:
       - Platform admin can read cross-tenant audit rows (no tenant_id IS NULL)
       - Tenant admin reads only own-tenant rows
       - Admin GET /api/control/audit-logs is logged via writeAuditLog
     → Only after P0

P2 — Remaining G-006C RLS consolidation waves
     (carts, cart_items, memberships, other tables per wave board)
     → Only after P0 + P1
```

## 8. Capability Vocabulary Anchor (OPS-SUPERADMIN-CAPABILITY-001 / GOVERNANCE-SYNC-033)

**Established:** 2026-03-02

Canonical vocabulary for TexQtic runtime authorization context:

| Concept | GUC / field | Values | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Plane / Realm** | `app.realm` | `tenant` \| `control` \| `system` \| `test` | Set by `withDbContext` via `DatabaseContext.realm` |
| **Platform Admin flag** | `app.is_admin` | `'true'` only | Set by `withAdminContext` and `withSuperAdminContext`; checked by `_admin_all` RLS policies |
| **Superadmin capability flag** | `app.is_superadmin` | `'true'` only | Set ONLY by `withSuperAdminContext`; tx-local; no RLS policies use this yet (future wave) |

**Rules (non-negotiable):**
- `withDbContext` MUST NOT set or clear `app.is_superadmin`
- `withAdminContext` MUST NOT set `app.is_superadmin`
- `app.is_admin` is NOT renamed in this TECS (rename deferred to future wave)
- Superadmin is always a strict superset of Platform Admin (`is_admin=true AND is_superadmin=true`)

**TECS-FBW-001 — Finance/Compliance/Dispute Authority Mutations**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: HIGH · Wave: 2  
**Compliance sub-unit: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-107 · 2026-03-07)**  
Files changed: services/adminApiClient.ts (adminPostWithHeaders — SAME-UNIT NECESSARY EXPANSION); services/controlPlaneService.ts (approveComplianceRequest, rejectComplianceRequest, ComplianceAuthorityBody, ComplianceAuthorityResponse); components/ControlPlane/ComplianceQueue.tsx (confirm dialog, per-row Approve/Reject, idempotency-key generation, re-fetch on success, inline error).  
Validation: typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0 · git diff --name-only: 3 files only.  
openapi.control-plane.json: NOT modified — both compliance POST routes already present in spec.  
**Finance sub-unit: ⏳ PENDING (FinanceOps.tsx — not yet implemented)**  
**Disputes sub-unit: ⏳ PENDING (DisputeCases.tsx — not yet implemented)**  
Backend confirmed: POST /api/control/finance/payouts/:id/{approve,reject}; POST /api/control/compliance/requests/:id/{approve,reject}; POST /api/control/disputes/:id/{resolve,escalate} — SUPER_ADMIN gated (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-035 CI guard).  
Affected (remaining): components/ControlPlane/FinanceOps.tsx, DisputeCases.tsx; services/controlPlaneService.ts  
Next action: TECS-FBW-001 Finance sub-unit — add approvePayoutMutation(), rejectPayoutMutation() to controlPlaneService.ts + confirm-before-submit UI in FinanceOps.tsx.

**TECS-FBW-002 — G-017 Trades Frontend Absent**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: HIGH · Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED · Wave: 3  
Backend confirmed: POST/GET /api/tenant/trades; POST .../transition (SM+MakerChecker+Sanctions); admin equivalents — implemented (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-005/015).  
Safety constraint (D-017-A): Do NOT send tenantId from client — server enforces from JWT claims. Enforced via z.never() server-side + query-param-only in listTrades().

**TECS-FBW-002-A — Control-plane read surface: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-110)**  
Implemented: services/controlPlaneService.ts (Trade types + listTrades()); components/ControlPlane/TradeOversight.tsx (NEW — read-only table, no mutation controls); layouts/SuperAdminShell.tsx (SAME-UNIT NECESSARY EXPANSION — 'TRADES' in AdminView union + NavLink); App.tsx (import + case 'TRADES'); shared/contracts/openapi.control-plane.json (SAME-UNIT NECESSARY EXPANSION — GET /api/control/trades path added).

**TECS-FBW-002-B — Tenant-facing panel: 🚫 BLOCKED**  
Blocker: No GET /api/tenant/trades route exists on the tenant plane.  
Next action: Design + implement GET /api/tenant/trades backend route in server/src/routes/tenant/trades.g017.ts, then create services/tradeService.ts + components/Tenant/TradesPanel.tsx + add TRADES to expView union.

**TECS-FBW-003 — G-018 Escrow Frontend Absent**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: HIGH · Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED · Wave: 3  
Backend confirmed: Full CRUD + transitions (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-011/012).  
Safety constraint (D-020-B): Balance derived from ledger SUM — frontend must not assume a balance field.

**TECS-FBW-003-A — Tenant read surface: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-111)**  
Implemented: services/escrowService.ts (NEW — EscrowAccount interface, listEscrows() via tenantGet, D-017-A + D-020-B enforced); components/Tenant/EscrowPanel.tsx (NEW — read-only list table, StateBadge, loading/error/empty states, no balance column, no mutations, onBack prop); layouts/Shells.tsx (SAME-UNIT NECESSARY EXPANSION — onNavigateEscrow added to ShellProps + all four shells); App.tsx (EscrowPanel import + expView extended to 'ESCROW' + renderExperienceContent branch + shell prop); shared/contracts/openapi.tenant.json (SAME-UNIT NECESSARY EXPANSION — GET /api/tenant/escrows path added).

**TECS-FBW-003-B — Mutations + detail view: 🔵 FUTURE SCOPE**  
Scope: Escrow create form; lifecycle transition controls (approve/reject/settle); GET /api/tenant/escrows/:escrowId detail panel with balance from ledger.  
Next action: Design TECS-FBW-003-B scope + D-020-B preview-confirm pattern before implementation.

**TECS-FBW-004 — G-019 Settlements Frontend Absent**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: HIGH · Status: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-113 · 2026-03-07) · Wave: 3  
Backend confirmed: POST /api/tenant/settlements/preview + /api/tenant/settlements; admin equivalents (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-004).  
Frontend status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED — services/settlementService.ts (NEW); components/Tenant/SettlementPreview.tsx (NEW); tenant preview-confirm two-phase flow; D-017-A compliant (no tenantId in body); D-020-B compliant (preview mandatory before commit; confirm form rendered only when wouldSucceed=true); actorType fixed to TENANT_USER; aiTriggered excluded; all settlement error codes surfaced (INSUFFICIENT_ESCROW_FUNDS/ENTITY_FROZEN/DUPLICATE_REFERENCE/STATE_MACHINE_DENIED/TRADE_DISPUTED/AI_HUMAN_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED/MAKER_CHECKER_REQUIRED); openapi.tenant.json includes both POST settlement routes; App.tsx + Shells.tsx SUNE.  
Wave 3 gate: ✅ CLOSED — all unblocked Wave 3 units complete: TECS-FBW-002-A ✅ · TECS-FBW-003-A ✅ · TECS-FBW-006-A ✅ · TECS-FBW-004 ✅. TECS-FBW-002-B remains 🚫 BLOCKED (backend dependency — GET /api/tenant/trades absent; not a Wave 3 gate prerequisite). Next: TECS-FBW-005 (Wave 4).

**TECS-FBW-005 — G-019 Certifications Frontend Absent**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: HIGH · Status: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-114 · 2026-03-07) · Wave: 4  
Backend confirmed: Full CRUD + lifecycle transitions (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-008).  
Frontend status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED — services/certificationService.ts (NEW); components/Tenant/CertificationsPanel.tsx (NEW — LIST/CREATE/DETAIL/TRANSITION); components/ControlPlane/CertificationsAdmin.tsx (NEW — read-only cross-tenant admin surface); D-017-A compliant (no orgId in body types); D-020-C compliant (aiTriggered excluded; ESCALATION_REQUIRED surfaced as result state not error); D-020-D compliant (reason mandatory for create+transition; frontend validates before submit); D-022-C compliant (CertificationsAdmin.tsx strictly read-only — no create/transition/patch controls); actorRole required free-text input (distinct from hardcoded actorType in TECS-FBW-004); 3 transition outcomes rendered distinctly (APPLIED/PENDING_APPROVAL/ESCALATION_REQUIRED); openapi.tenant.json (5 certification paths added); openapi.control-plane.json (2 certification admin paths added); App.tsx + layouts/Shells.tsx + layouts/SuperAdminShell.tsx SUNE; AggregatorShell dead unconditional Certifications button replaced with conditional pattern; DPPPassport.tsx untouched (certifications_v1 snapshot view — constitutionally out of scope); ComplianceQueue.tsx untouched; 8 files total (3 NEW + 5 SUNE); typecheck EXIT 0; lint EXIT 0.  
Note: DPPPassport.tsx reads certification data from DPP snapshot view (pre-computed) — NOT from certification lifecycle endpoints. This architecture is preserved and confirmed by the implementation.

**TECS-FBW-006 — G-022 Escalations Frontend Absent [misrouting claim disproved]**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: HIGH · Status: TECS-FBW-006-A: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-112 · 2026-03-07) · Wave: 3  
Backend confirmed: GET/POST /api/tenant/escalations; GET/POST/upgrade/resolve /api/control/escalations (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-047).  
Frontend status — tenant: ✅ IMPLEMENTED — services/escalationService.ts (NEW); components/Tenant/EscalationsPanel.tsx (NEW); read-only list, JWT-org scoped (D-017-A), no mutation controls.  
Frontend status — control: ✅ IMPLEMENTED — components/ControlPlane/EscalationOversight.tsx (NEW); orgId input-gated; read-only list; freezeRecommendation informational only (D-022-C); no kill-switch toggle.  
Misrouting claim DISPROVED: DisputeCases.tsx correctly calls GET /api/control/disputes (event-log domain, structurally separate from G-022 escalation_events). DisputeCases.tsx is not misrouted and was not modified.  
TECS-FBW-006-B (escalation mutations: upgrade/resolve/override) remains future scope.

**TECS-FBW-007 — Cart Summaries Dead Service Code**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: MEDIUM · Status: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-116 · 2026-03-08) · Wave: 4  
Backend confirmed: GET /api/control/marketplace/cart-summaries + /:cartId implemented.  
Frontend status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED — components/ControlPlane/CartSummariesPanel.tsx (NEW — search-on-demand, tenant_id required before fetch, cursor pagination via next_cursor, row-selection detail via getCartSummaryByCartId, LoadingState/ErrorState/EmptyState, READ-ONLY badge, no mutation controls); layouts/SuperAdminShell.tsx (SUNE — CART_SUMMARIES added to AdminView union + NavLink under Governance section after Trade Oversight); App.tsx (SUNE — CartSummariesPanel import + case 'CART_SUMMARIES'); controlPlaneService.ts: untouched (getCartSummaries + getCartSummaryByCartId already implemented); no tenant-plane work; no OpenAPI changes; no server changes; 3 files total (1 NEW + 2 SUNE); typecheck EXIT 0; lint EXIT 0.

**TECS-FBW-008 — WL Settings Custom Domain Dead (EXPERIENCE Shell)**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: MEDIUM · Status: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-104 · 2026-03-07) · Wave: 1  
Context: WLDomainsPanel.tsx in WL_ADMIN shell is fully wired (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-093). Gap was in EXPERIENCE shell WhiteLabelSettings.tsx domain card only.  
Resolution: Added optional onNavigateDomains?: () => void prop to WhiteLabelSettings.tsx. Dead uncontrolled input + no-op Connect button + hardcoded DNS block removed. WL_ADMIN BRANDING context: ‘Manage Custom Domains →’ button routes to DOMAINS panel via setWlAdminView(‘DOMAINS’). EXPERIENCE SETTINGS context: static informational note only. App.tsx BRANDING case wired; SETTINGS call site unchanged. WLDomainsPanel.tsx: zero changes. typecheck EXIT 0; lint EXIT 0. App.tsx + components/Tenant/WhiteLabelSettings.tsx only.

**TECS-FBW-011 — Catalog basePrice vs price — CRITICAL Runtime Bug**  
Source: NEW_IN_COPILOT · Severity: CRITICAL · Status: **CLOSED** · Wave: 1 — SHIP BLOCKER  
Runtime impact: Every catalog item renders as `$undefined.00` across all shells.  
Root cause: CatalogItem interface declares `basePrice?: number`; backend Prisma uses `price` field; App.tsx renders `p.basePrice` at 3 sites.  
Affected: App.tsx (3 render sites); services/catalogService.ts (CatalogItem interface).  
Fix: Update interface to `price: number`; update all `p.basePrice` references to `p.price` — frontend only, no backend change.  
**IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-096 · 2026-03-06):**  
- services/catalogService.ts: `basePrice?: number` removed from CatalogItem interface; `price: number` (required) confirmed as canonical field.  
- App.tsx: lines 499, 711, 854 — all `p.basePrice` → `p.price`.  
- components/WhiteLabelAdmin/WLCollectionsPanel.tsx: line 50 — `displayPrice = item.basePrice ?? item.price` → `displayPrice = item.price` (4th render site; audit had under-counted; discovered at typecheck; same allowlist extension authorized within TECS-FBW-011 scope).  
- typecheck EXIT 0 (no TS errors); lint EXIT 0 (scoped to 3 changed files; pre-existing middleware.ts errors confirmed unrelated and pre-existing).  
- git diff --name-only: App.tsx, components/WhiteLabelAdmin/WLCollectionsPanel.tsx, services/catalogService.ts — no unintended files.  
- No backend change; no schema/RLS/migration change; no OpenAPI edit.  
- Commit: `[TEXQTIC] frontend: fix catalog price field - basePrice to price (TECS-FBW-011)`

**TECS-FBW-LINT-001 — middleware.ts ESLint Edge Runtime Globals — Root Lint Gate Failure**  
Source: DISCOVERED during TECS-FBW-011 closeout · Severity: LOW · Status: **CLOSED** · Wave: Immediate (repo-gate precedence)  
Root cause: `eslint.config.js` declared only basic browser globals (`window`, `document`, `fetch`, etc.) but `middleware.ts` runs in a Vercel Edge Runtime (V8 isolate) and uses Web API globals (`TextEncoder`, `crypto`, `Response`, `Request`, `Headers`, `URL`) plus `process.env` (Vercel compile-time injection, used with `typeof process !== 'undefined'` guard). ESLint `no-undef` flagged all 7 as errors (18 instances across 8 line groups).  
Affected: `eslint.config.js` only. `middleware.ts` was NOT changed (runtime behavior preserved).  
Fix: Added a targeted override block in `eslint.config.js` scoped to `files: ['middleware.ts']` only, declaring the 7 Edge Runtime globals as `readonly`. No blanket suppressions. No `@ts-ignore` or `eslint-disable` comments.  
**IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-097 · 2026-03-06):**  
- eslint.config.js: targeted override block added before the `ignores` block; 7 globals declared for `middleware.ts` only.  
- `pnpm run lint` EXIT 0 — full root lint gate green (no errors, no warnings).  
- `pnpm run typecheck` EXIT 0 — still clean post-config change.  
- git diff --name-only: `eslint.config.js` only — no unintended files.  
- No middleware.ts change; no runtime behavior change; no security posture change.  
- Commit: `[TEXQTIC] chore: fix middleware root lint globals (TECS-FBW-LINT-001)`

**TECS-FBW-012 — TeamManagement Edit Access Dead Button**  
Source: RECONFIRMED; confirmed by Q2 tracker §12.3 "Membership edit ❌ Not implemented" · Severity: MEDIUM · Status: VALIDATED · Wave: 5  
Frontend status: `<button>Edit Access</button>` has no onClick; no role-change service method.  
Backend status: No PATCH /api/tenant/memberships/:id route exists.  
Next action: Backend route design required first; then wire UI with role-change modal.

**TECS-FBW-013 — B2B Request Quote Dead Button**  
Source: NEW_IN_COPILOT · Severity: LOW · Status: DEFERRED (DEFERRED_BY_DOCTRINE) · Wave: 5  
No backend quote endpoint; B2B quote flow is a future phase item. Keep UI in disabled/hidden state pending product decision.

**TECS-FBW-014 — Post-Checkout No Order Confirmation State**  
Source: NEW_IN_COPILOT · Severity: MEDIUM · Status: ✅ CLOSED · Wave: 1  
Implementation: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-102 · 2026-03-07 · typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0  
Files changed: App.tsx + components/Cart/Cart.tsx (SAME-UNIT NECESSARY EXPANSION)  
Fix: Added `ORDER_CONFIRMED` to `appState` union type in App.tsx. Added `confirmedOrderId: string | null` state. Cart.tsx gained optional `onCheckoutSuccess?: (result: CheckoutResult) => void` prop — when provided, checkout success is propagated to App-level instead of local in-cart confirmation (fallback behavior preserved when prop omitted). On checkout success, App.tsx stores `result.orderId` in `confirmedOrderId`, closes the cart overlay, and transitions `appState` to `ORDER_CONFIRMED`. `ORDER_CONFIRMED` case in `renderCurrentState()` renders a full-screen centered confirmation page (orderId first 8 chars, status note, grand total) with two navigation paths: “View My Orders” (→ setExpView(‘ORDERS’) + setAppState(‘EXPERIENCE’)) and “Continue Shopping” (→ setExpView(‘HOME’) + setAppState(‘EXPERIENCE’)).  
Acceptance criteria: ALL MET  
  ✅ Successful checkout no longer silently discards orderId  
  ✅ ORDER_CONFIRMED state exists and is reachable from checkout success path  
  ✅ Confirmation UI renders after successful checkout  
  ✅ orderId preserved in confirmedOrderId state for display  
  ✅ View My Orders and Continue Shopping navigation paths defined; user not stranded  
  ✅ Existing non-WL and non-checkout flows compile and remain intact  
  ✅ typecheck EXIT 0  
  ✅ lint EXIT 0  
  ✅ diff narrow and auditable (2 files only: App.tsx + Cart.tsx expansion)  
  ✅ no unrelated checkout or order flow refactor occurred  
Residual follow-up: None.

**TECS-FBW-015 — G-016 Traceability CRUD Frontend Absent**  
Source: RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT · Severity: HIGH · Status: VALIDATED · Wave: 4  
Backend confirmed: POST/GET nodes; GET neighbors; POST/GET edges; admin plane equivalents (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-009).  
Note: DPPPassport.tsx consumes GET /api/tenant/dpp/:nodeId (snapshot view) — different endpoint; traceability data creation is dark.  
Next action: Create services/traceabilityService.ts; add node/edge creation forms; extend DPPPassport.tsx or create TraceabilityPanel.tsx.

**TECS-FBW-016 — Tenant Audit Logs UI Absent**  
Source: NEW_IN_COPILOT · Severity: MEDIUM · Status: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-117 · 2026-03-08) · Wave: 4  
Backend confirmed: GET /api/tenant/audit-logs implemented (server/src/routes/tenant.ts line 112); tenantAuthMiddleware + databaseContextMiddleware; response `{ logs: AuditLog[], count: number }`; take: 50 hardcoded; newest-first; no pagination/filter params.  
Frontend status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED — components/Tenant/TenantAuditLogs.tsx (NEW — EXPERIENCE-only read-only panel; tenantGet('/tenant/audit-logs') on mount; renders createdAt, action, entity, entityId, actorType, realm; beforeJson/afterJson/metadataJson intentionally excluded; LoadingState + ErrorState + EmptyState; Refresh button; footer: server limit 50 · read-only; no mutation controls; no filter/pagination UI; RealmBadge + ActorTypeBadge colour maps); App.tsx (SUNE — expView extended 'AUDIT_LOGS'; TenantAuditLogs import + renderExperienceContent branch + onNavigateAuditLogs shell prop); layouts/Shells.tsx (SUNE — onNavigateAuditLogs in ShellProps; conditional Audit Log button in AggregatorShell, B2BShell, B2CShell, WhiteLabelShell; WhiteLabelAdminShell untouched — different interface).  
Validation: typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0 (0 errors, 108 warnings — baseline unchanged) · git diff --name-only: App.tsx + layouts/Shells.tsx (3 files total: 1 NEW + 2 SUNE).  
🏁 WAVE 4 COMPLETE — all units (FBW-005, FBW-015, FBW-007, FBW-016) closed.

**TECS-FBW-017 — CatalogItem.category Grouping May Fail**  
Source: NEW_IN_COPILOT · Severity: LOW · Status: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-105 · 2026-03-07) · Wave: 1  
Root cause (filed): WLCollectionsPanel.tsx groups items by item.category; category typed optional; if null/undefined, grouping degrades silently.  
Resolution: Governance-only closeout. Direct inspection confirms WLCollectionsPanel.tsx (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-066) already implements full defensive grouping: `(item.category ?? '').trim() || UNCATEGORISED`. Null, undefined, and whitespace-only categories all route to a stable ‘Uncategorised’ bucket sorted last. PROVISIONAL risk was resolved when the component was shipped. No code change required or made.

**TECS-FBW-018 — Plan BASIC→TRIAL Enum Mapping**  
Source: NEW_IN_COPILOT · Severity: LOW · Status: PROVISIONAL · Wave: 0 (verify)  
Root cause: Backend returns plan: 'BASIC'; frontend type uses 'TRIAL' | 'PAID' | 'ENTERPRISE'; explicit mapping in TenantRegistry.tsx.  
Next action: Confirm if 'BASIC' is canonical or legacy alias; align enum if needed.

**TECS-FBW-019 — lifecycleState vs status (Handled)**  
Source: NEW_IN_COPILOT · Status: DEFERRED  
GAP-ORDER-LC-001 formally closed (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-063). No further action.

**TECS-FBW-020 — WL Admin Invite Shell Routing**  
Source: NEW_IN_CODEX · Severity: MEDIUM · Status: ✅ CLOSED · Wave: 1  
VER-002 executed: 2026-03-06 · Verdict: FAIL · Evidence: direct file inspection (read-only; no code modified)
Implementation: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-101 · 2026-03-06 · typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0  
File changed: App.tsx only (3 targeted edits; no other file touched)
Fix: introduced `wlAdminInviting: boolean` WL-admin-local substate in App.tsx. `renderWLAdminContent()` early-returns `<InviteMemberForm onBack={() => setWlAdminInviting(false)} />` when `wlAdminInviting` is true, keeping `appState === 'WL_ADMIN'` throughout — `WhiteLabelAdminShell` never drops. `case 'STAFF':` now calls `setWlAdminInviting(true)` instead of `setAppState('INVITE_MEMBER')`. `onViewChange` in the `WL_ADMIN` block resets `wlAdminInviting` on nav change. EXPERIENCE invite flow (lines 527-529) unchanged. Shells.tsx untouched — `activeView: string` is unconstrained.  
Acceptance criteria: ALL MET  
  ✅ Invite from WL Admin STAFF renders inside WhiteLabelAdminShell  
  ✅ InviteMemberForm reachable without switching into EXPERIENCE shell  
  ✅ Back from InviteMemberForm returns to WL Admin STAFF in-shell  
  ✅ Existing non-WL invite flows compile and remain intact  
  ✅ typecheck EXIT 0  
  ✅ lint EXIT 0  
  ✅ diff narrow and auditable (App.tsx only)  
  ✅ no unrelated navigation refactor occurred  
Residual follow-up: None. No partial implementation.

Backend gap: G-028 B1/B2/C1/C2/C3 all Deferred Wave 5+ (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-095). Not a wiring gap — backend route does not exist.

**TECS-FBW-ADMINRBAC — AdminRBAC No Backend Route**

Finding: AdminRBAC.tsx "Invite Admin" and "Revoke" buttons have no onClick; no /api/control/admin-users route in control.ts.  
Security note: Absence of auditable admin provisioning is a product gap and security posture concern. Not a wiring gap — requires backend route design.

**TECS-FBW-MOQ — MOQ_NOT_MET 422 UX Gap**  
Source: NEW_IN_COPILOT · Severity: MEDIUM · Status: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-103 · 2026-03-07) · Wave: 1  
Finding: POST /api/tenant/cart/items returns 422 MOQ_NOT_MET; frontend had no error toast or inline message.  
Resolution: B2CAddToCartButton (App.tsx) — addError state added; APIError.message surfaced inline below button in rose-600 text; error cleared on each new attempt; success path unchanged. App.tsx only. typecheck EXIT 0; lint EXIT 0.

**TECS-FBW-OA-001 — OpenAPI Tenant Contract Drift**

Finding: openapi.tenant.json missing checkout, orders, orders/:id/status, domains, dpp, and other active endpoints.  
Next action: Enumerate paths in tenant.ts vs openapi.tenant.json; produce delta list; register as governance debt; update OpenAPI in same wave as corresponding gap fix.

**TECS-FBW-OA-002 — OpenAPI Control-Plane Contract Drift**  
Source: NEW_IN_CODEX · Severity: HIGH · Status: VERIFY_REQUIRED · Wave: 0 (inventory); fix per implementing wave  
Finding: openapi.control-plane.json missing /finance/payouts, /compliance/requests, /disputes, /system/health, /whoami, impersonation routes.  
Next action: Enumerate paths in control.ts vs openapi.control-plane.json; produce delta list.

**PW5-AUTH-ORG-IDENTIFIER-LESS-LOGIN — Identifier-Less Tenant Login Remediation Chain (PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-ROUTE-REGISTRATION-VERIFICATION · 2026-03-14)**  
Source: POST-FEATURE REMEDIATION CHAIN · Severity: HIGH · Status: ✅ VERIFIED CLOSED · Wave: 5  
Parent feature: TECS-FBW-AUTH-001 (slug resolver, commit 476b3d3, 2026-03-13) delivered slug-based tenant resolution and removed SEEDED_TENANTS.  
This chain delivers email-based org detection (identifier-less login) — the complete tenant lookup flow requiring only an email address.  
  
**D-009 — Tenant-by-email login failure under FORCE RLS — ✅ VERIFIED CLOSED**  
Root cause: GET /api/public/tenants/by-email executed the memberships SELECT under the bare `postgres` superuser role; FORCE RLS on `public.memberships` + `public.users` (canonical Wave 3 Tail pattern with `texqtic_app`-scoped policies) returned 0 rows — deny-by-default.  
Resolution units:  
  - PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-RLS-REMEDIATION: Route query wrapped in SET LOCAL ROLE texqtic_service; minimum SELECT grants on public.memberships + public.users granted to texqtic_service role; FORCE RLS remains fully intact for all other roles and paths.  
  - PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-RLS-MIGRATION-COMPLIANCE: Migration 20260319000001_pw5_by_email_service_role_grants applied to production Supabase via psql (OPS-ENV-001); Prisma ledger synced via resolve --applied.  
  - PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-ROUTE-REGISTRATION-REMEDIATION: publicRoutes absent from api/index.ts (Vercel serverless entrypoint); production returned 404 for all /api/public/* routes; fix imports and registers publicRoutes at /api/public prefix in api/index.ts matching local/dev entrypoint order; commit be151c7.  
  - PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-ROUTE-REGISTRATION-VERIFICATION: Production verification completed (2026-03-14).  
Production evidence (2026-03-14):

**TECS-FBW-RLS-001 — RLS-Only Posture Governance Clarification (VER-007 PASS · TECS-FBW-RLS-001-GOV · 2026-03-13)**  
Source: NEW_IN_CODEX · Severity: MEDIUM · Status: ✅ CLOSED · Wave: 0 (governance statement only; no code change)  
VER-007 executed: 2026-03-13 · Verdict: FAIL (governance defect confirmed — no system-level doctrine; only memberships-specific Q2 §12.2 precedent; stale `app.tenant_id` GUC reference in contract file) → governance-writing unit authorized.  
Finding: Multiple tenant routes rely on RLS (withDbContext/app.org_id GUC) for boundary enforcement without explicit `where: { org_id }` app-layer filters.  
Context: Q2 tracker §12.2 documents the intentional decision for memberships specifically.  
Secondary defect: `shared/contracts/rls-policy.md` listed `app.tenant_id` as the session GUC. Canonical implementation GUC is `app.org_id`. Corrected by this unit.  
Closure: System-level RLS-only posture doctrine written in `shared/contracts/rls-policy.md` (§ System-Level RLS-Only Posture · TECS-FBW-RLS-001-GOV · 2026-03-13). Doctrine explicitly states:  
  - FORCE RLS on `app.org_id` is the canonical tenant isolation enforcement boundary.  
  - Tenant scope is bound from JWT/server context via `withDbContext`; client-supplied IDs are never trusted.  
  - For tables with complete, governance-verified FORCE RLS coverage, app-layer `where: { org_id }` filters are optional defense-in-depth, not the enforcement source of truth.  
  - Routes with incomplete/unverified RLS coverage, BYPASSRLS paths, or cross-tenant admin reads still require explicit app-layer filtering or a documented exception.  
  - Exception recording protocol defined.  
  - `app.org_id` is now the canonical GUC in all governance documents; `app.tenant_id` is stale and deprecated.  
Files changed: `shared/contracts/rls-policy.md` only (governance contract — no runtime code).  
No application code, schema, migration, or RLS policy was modified.

**TECS-FBW-PROV-001 — Tenant Provisioning Contract Mismatch (VER-001 CLOSED · 2026-03-06)**  
Source: CROSS_REPORT_CONFLICT → RESOLVED · Severity: HIGH · Status: VALIDATED · Wave: 1  
VER-001 executed: 2026-03-06 · Verdict: FAIL · Evidence: direct file inspection (read-only; no code modified)  
Request field mismatch — all 5 fields wrong:  
  - Frontend sends `name` → backend Zod expects `orgName` — absent from payload; validation fails  
  - Frontend sends `ownerEmail` → backend Zod expects `primaryAdminEmail` — absent; validation fails  
  - Frontend sends `ownerPassword` → backend Zod expects `primaryAdminPassword` — absent; validation fails  
  - Frontend sends `slug` → not in Zod schema; silently stripped  
  - Frontend sends `type` → not in Zod schema; silently stripped  
Response shape mismatch: backend returns flat `{orgId,slug,userId,membershipId}`; frontend `ProvisionTenantResponse` expects nested `{tenant:{id,name,slug,type,status},owner:{id,email}}`.  
Runtime consequence: deterministic HTTP 400 on every call — `provisionBodySchema.safeParse()` always returns `success: false`.  
Codex §4.1 assessment: CONFIRMED CORRECT. Copilot §3 "✅ Wired" superseded by field-level inspection (call path exists; contract was never correct).  
Additional finding (doc-only): stale comment in tenantProvision.ts header says `/api/admin/tenants/provision`; actual registration is `/api/control/tenants/provision` — no runtime impact.  
Implementation: ✅ CLOSED — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-099 · 2026-03-06 · typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0  
Files changed: `services/controlPlaneService.ts` (interfaces aligned), `components/ControlPlane/TenantRegistry.tsx` (call site + response), `server/src/routes/admin/tenantProvision.ts` (doc-only stale comment fix).  
Next: VER-002 (TECS-FBW-020 — WL Admin invite shell routing).

## PRE-WAVE-5-REMEDIATION-001 — Platform Wiring and Runtime Truth Reconciliation

**Registered:** 2026-03-08  
**Authority:** Paresh  
**Classification:** Anti-drift — Pre-Wave-5  
**Predecessor:** SEQUENCING-LOCK-PRE-WAVE-5 (2026-03-08) · GOVERNANCE-SYNC-118  
**Source audits:** Full TexQtic Platform Map audit + Navigation verification audit (both completed 2026-03-08, repo inspection only)  
**Detail tracker:** `docs/governance/IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-03.md` → Pre-Wave-5 Remediation Program section  
**Master plan:** `docs/governance/MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2026-03.md` → Section 10  
**Audit registration:** `docs/governance/audits/2026-03-audit-reconciliation-matrix.md` → Section 9  
**Status:** REGISTERED — Verification tranche must complete before any implementation unit begins

### Program Purpose

Two independent repo-truth audits completed 2026-03-08 following GOVERNANCE-SYNC-118 produced a mixed set of findings: agreed wired surfaces, verified-dead UI, backend-exists/UI-missing gaps, and placeholder control-plane panels that must not anchor Wave 5 planning. This program establishes the ordered remediation sequence that governs all pre-Wave-5 execution. Old expansion planning assumptions are superseded by audit output. All implementation ordering is based only on reconciled conclusions.

> **Anti-drift rule:** No sub-unit in an implementation tranche may begin until all sub-units in the verification tranche that gate it are resolved and recorded in governance. No agent or prompt may bypass this rule.

### Reconciled Audit Conclusions

| # | Finding Type | Classification | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Both audits agree on wired-status of a surface | `AGREED` | Implementation-ready; assigned to wiring tranche sub-unit |
| 2 | Audits differ on wire status | `VERIFY_REQUIRED` | Resolve by targeted repo inspection; assigned to verification tranche |
| 3 | Nav item / action visible but no backend route or wiring | `DEAD_UI` | Must be hidden/gated before further expansion; assigned to UX correctness tranche |
| 4 | Backend route exists; no UI surface wired | `BACKEND_EXISTS_UI_MISSING` | Higher priority than net-new domain work |
| 5 | Static control-plane docs/spec/roadmap panel | `PLACEHOLDER_PANEL` | Does not count as a wired surface; must not anchor Wave 5 planning |

### Verification Tranche (Gate for All Implementation Tranches)

All four verification sub-units must resolve to ✅ with evidence before any implementation tranche sub-unit begins.

| ID | Name | Gate Target | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PW5-V1 | DPP runtime verification | PW5-U2, PW5-W1 area | ✅ VERIFIED — 2026-03-08 | HTTP 404 from GET /api/tenant/dpp/{uuid} — route live, DB query executed, RLS enforcement confirmed. "DPP snapshot not found or access denied." Auth: valid tenant JWT (impersonated session). Classification: DPP / Passport = WORKING. |
| PW5-V2 | Tenant Audit Logs runtime verification | PW5-W3 area | ✅ VERIFIED — 2026-03-08 | Backend runtime-proven (HTTP 401 unauth + HTTP 200 auth). Frontend path mismatch fixed in PW5-FIX-V2A: TenantAuditLogs.tsx '/tenant/audit-logs' corrected to '/api/tenant/audit-logs'. Post-fix runtime: HTTP 200 { logs: [], count: 0, success: true }. TSC_EXIT:0. Classification: Tenant Audit Logs = WORKING. |
| PW5-V3 | TenantType source-of-truth verification | PW5-U1, PW5-U4 area | ❌ FAIL — B2-DESIGN COMPLETE (2026-03-09) | Enum mismatch confirmed across 4 layers. DB+Prisma: {B2B, B2C, INTERNAL}. Frontend: {AGGREGATOR, B2B, B2C, WHITE_LABEL}. AGGREGATOR and WHITE_LABEL unreachable via active Prisma code path. INTERNAL has no frontend shell (silent AGGREGATOR fallback). Backend type alias stale. 3 defects registered: PW5-V3-DEF-001/002/003. Remediation required. **B2-DESIGN architectural decision locked (2026-03-09):** Canonical model: `tenant_category` (AGGREGATOR/B2B/B2C/INTERNAL) + `is_white_label BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` + explicit `resolveExperienceShell()` policy. Silent `default:` fallback FORBIDDEN. Remediation path approved: B2-REM-1 → B2-REM-2 → B2-REM-3 → B2-REM-4 → B2-REM-5. **Remediation progress — 2026-03-09:** B2-REM-1 ✅ CLOSED (schema layer · commit d893524 · 2026-03-09 · AGGREGATOR added to TenantType enum; is_white_label added to tenants + organizations; legacy WHITE_LABEL org rows migrated); B2-REM-2 through B2-REM-5 ⏳ pending. PW5-V3 remains ❌ FAIL overall until all remediation units complete. Note: schema layer complete ≠ full defect closure — backend serialization, frontend routing, OpenAPI contracts, and provisioning flow still open in B2-REM-2–5. |
| PW5-V4 | Shell action verification | PW5-U3 | ✅ VERIFIED — 2026-03-08 | All shell/global nav and action surfaces classified by static inspection. WORKING: 11 EXPERIENCE nav items, 6 WL_ADMIN views, 15 SuperAdmin views. DEAD NAV: B2B Negotiations, B2B Invoices, WL Collections, WL The Journal. DEAD ACTION: AdminRBAC Invite Admin/Revoke, AiGovernance Kill Switch + secondary buttons, Aggregator Post RFQ, B2B Create RFQ. STATIC/INCORRECT: B2C cart badge hardcoded "3". PLACEHOLDER_PANEL: Blueprints, BackendSkeleton, ApiDocs, DataModel, Middleware. STUB: AdminRBAC. PARTIAL: AiGovernance. Findings mapped to PW5-U1 through PW5-U4. No implementation change required. |

**PW5-V1 runtime evidence (2026-03-08):**
- Server health: GET /health → HTTP 200 ✅
- Route existence: GET /api/tenant/dpp/{uuid} without auth → HTTP 401 ✅ (route registered, auth-gated)
- Runtime call: GET /api/tenant/dpp/00000000-0000-4000-a000-000000000001 with valid tenant JWT → HTTP 404 ✅
- Error body: `{"error":{"code":"NOT_FOUND","message":"DPP snapshot not found or access denied"}}` — confirms route reached DB layer, views queried, RLS applied, no node for this org
- Auth path: tenantAuthMiddleware passed → databaseContextMiddleware passed → withDbContext executed
- JWT: admin-issued impersonation token (tenant-scoped, realm=TENANT) — value not recorded
- Repo truth confirmed: GET /api/tenant/dpp/:nodeId registered in server/src/routes/tenant.ts; DPPPassport.tsx calls tenantGet(); nav wired all four shells
- Classification: **DPP / Passport = WORKING** (implementation complete and runtime-verified)

**PW5-V1 TECS Unit B1 — Supplemental static inspection evidence (2026-03-09):**
- Unit: TECS Unit B1 — DPP Runtime Verification · Date: 2026-03-09 · Verdict: PASS
- Method: Read-only static inspection — full call chain traced UI→API→Backend→DB; no files modified
- 3 snapshot views confirmed present in committed migrations:
  - `dpp_snapshot_products_v1` — SECURITY INVOKER; manufacturer fields restored in migration `20260316000003_g025_dpp_views_manufacturer_restore`
  - `dpp_snapshot_lineage_v1` — SECURITY INVOKER; recursive CTE depth cap 20 in migration `20260316000001_g025_dpp_snapshot_views`
  - `dpp_snapshot_certifications_v1` — SECURITY INVOKER in migration `20260316000001_g025_dpp_snapshot_views`
- Tenant isolation chain: `withDbContext(prisma, dbContext)` sets `app.org_id`; views SECURITY INVOKER; FORCE RLS fires; 404 fail-closed guard on empty product rows
- Payload match: backend `DppSnapshot` response shape confirmed against frontend interface — all fields consistent
- Git diff: no files modified — `git diff --name-only` was empty in TECS Unit B1 session
- Reclassification: **DPP / Passport = VERIFIED** (TECS Unit B1 PASS · 2026-03-09)

**PW5-V1-DEF-001 — Defect Registration (2026-03-09):**
- ID: PW5-V1-DEF-001
- Type: Governance Contract Drift
- Discovered by: TECS Unit B1 (read-only static inspection)
- Description: `GET /api/tenant/dpp/:nodeId` is absent from `shared/contracts/openapi.tenant.json`
- Affected contract file: `shared/contracts/openapi.tenant.json`
- Impact: Documentation only — runtime is not affected; route is registered, auth-gated, and functional
- Severity: Low (documentation drift — non-blocking)
- Action required: Future contract-sync TECS unit to add the missing path definition
- Classification: Non-blocking defect; does not affect PW5-V1 PASS verdict

**PW5-V2 runtime evidence (2026-03-08):**
- Server health: GET /health → HTTP 200 ✅
- Route existence: GET /api/tenant/audit-logs without auth → HTTP 401 ✅ (route registered, auth-gated)
- Runtime call: GET /api/tenant/audit-logs with valid tenant JWT (impersonated session) → HTTP 200 ✅
- Response body: `{"data":{"logs":[],"count":0},"success":true}` — backend fully operational; empty array correct (RLS scopes to new test tenant with no audit events)
- Auth path: tenantAuthMiddleware passed → databaseContextMiddleware passed → withDbContext executed → tx.auditLog.findMany returned
- JWT: admin-issued impersonation token (tenant-scoped, realm=TENANT) — value not recorded
- Frontend path mismatch confirmed by static analysis:
  - `TenantAuditLogs.tsx` calls `tenantGet('/tenant/audit-logs')` (missing `/api` prefix)
  - `tenantApiClient.ts` → `apiClient.ts` resolves to `API_BASE_URL + endpoint` = `'' + '/tenant/audit-logs'` = `/tenant/audit-logs`
  - Backend listens at `/api/tenant/audit-logs` (prefix `/api` from `tenantRoutes` registration)
  - `vite.config.ts` has no proxy — no bridge between the two paths
  - Runtime consequence: frontend request hits SPA router, not Fastify. Component will always error.
- Classification at PW5-V2 close: **Tenant Audit Logs = PARTIAL** (backend working; frontend path broken)

**PW5-FIX-V2A fix evidence (2026-03-08):**
- Fix applied: `TenantAuditLogs.tsx` line 120 — `'/tenant/audit-logs'` → `'/api/tenant/audit-logs'`
- Scope: one file, one line — `components/Tenant/TenantAuditLogs.tsx` only
- `git diff --name-only` → `components/Tenant/TenantAuditLogs.tsx` only ✅
- `tsc --noEmit` → TSC_EXIT:0 ✅
- Post-fix runtime call: GET /api/tenant/audit-logs with valid tenant JWT → HTTP 200 ✅
- Post-fix response: `{"data":{"logs":[],"count":0},"success":true}` — component no longer fails due to path mismatch
- Call chain confirmed: `tenantGet('/api/tenant/audit-logs')` → `apiClient.get` → `fetch('' + '/api/tenant/audit-logs')` → Fastify route ✅
- JWT: admin-issued impersonation token (tenant-scoped, realm=TENANT) — value not recorded
- Reclassification: **Tenant Audit Logs = WORKING** (backend operational + frontend path corrected + post-fix runtime-verified)

**PW5-V3 static analysis evidence (2026-03-08) — SUPERSEDED by TECS Unit B2 (2026-03-09):**
- Original classification: CONSISTENT (2026-03-08 static pass)
- Superseded by: TECS Unit B2 deeper enum inspection — revealed schema-level mismatch not caught by routing-chain-only inspection
- See TECS Unit B2 evidence below for full findings

**PW5-V3 TECS Unit B2 — Full Enum Inspection Evidence (2026-03-09) — VERDICT: FAIL:**
- Method: Read-only multi-layer static inspection — Prisma schema, DB migration, backend type alias, API routes, frontend enum, OpenAPI spec
- **DB type (enforced):** Init migration line 2: `CREATE TYPE "tenant_type" AS ENUM ('B2B', 'B2C', 'INTERNAL')` — only these 3 values can ever be stored in `tenants.type`
- **Prisma schema:** `enum TenantType { B2B; B2C; INTERNAL; @@map("tenant_type") }` — matches DB type exactly
- **Backend type alias** (`server/src/types/index.ts` line 66): `export type TenantType = 'B2B' | 'B2C' | 'INTERNAL'` — matches schema
- **Runtime expectation** (`server/src/routes/auth.ts` comment line 376): `Expected values: 'B2B' | 'WHITE_LABEL' | 'AGGREGATOR' | 'B2C' | null` — **diverges from both schema and type alias**
- **Frontend enum** (`types.ts` lines 2–6): `{ AGGREGATOR, B2B, B2C, WHITE_LABEL }` — **no INTERNAL; has AGGREGATOR and WHITE_LABEL which cannot be produced by Prisma**
- **Trigger path** (`sync_tenants_to_organizations()`): `org_type = NEW.type::text` — casts Prisma enum to text; only {B2B, B2C, INTERNAL} can flow into `organizations.org_type`
- **Active provision route** (`POST /api/control/tenants/provision`): accepts no `type` field — all provisioned tenants default to B2B
- **OpenAPI control-plane:** provision body `type` enum `["B2B", "B2C", "INTERNAL"]` — matches schema but belongs to deprecated path
- **OpenAPI tenant:** `tenantType` mentioned only as untyped string query param for AI insights — no TenantType schema component defined in either spec
- **Shell routing (App.tsx switch):** handles {AGGREGATOR, B2B, B2C, WHITE_LABEL}; `INTERNAL` hits `default: AggregatorShell` (silent fallback)
- **Git diff:** no files modified — read-only inspection confirmed
- Classification: **FAIL** — enum mismatch across layers; AGGREGATOR and WHITE_LABEL architecturally required but schema-unreachable; INTERNAL has no frontend representation

**PW5-V3-DEF-001 — Defect Registration (2026-03-09):**
- ID: PW5-V3-DEF-001
- Title: INTERNAL tenant type lacks frontend representation
- Type: Enum mismatch — backend-present, frontend-absent
- Severity: Medium
- Description: `INTERNAL` exists in the DB `tenant_type` PG enum, in `server/prisma/schema.prisma`, and in `server/src/types/index.ts`. It is absent from the frontend `TenantType` enum in `types.ts`.
- Runtime behavior: If a tenant row has `type = 'INTERNAL'`, the value passes through `organizations.org_type` → API → frontend unmodified. The login validity guard in `App.tsx` treats it as unrecognized and silently falls back to `TenantType.AGGREGATOR`, routing the user to `AggregatorShell`.
- Impact: Incorrect shell routing for any `INTERNAL` tenant — silent, no error surfaced
- Action required: Product decision on `INTERNAL` disposition; either add to frontend enum with a dedicated shell, or deprecate and remove from DB/Prisma enum
- Classification: Non-blocking at runtime (fallback prevents crash); blocking for correctness

**PW5-V3-DEF-002 — Defect Registration (2026-03-09):**
- ID: PW5-V3-DEF-002
- Title: AGGREGATOR and WHITE_LABEL unreachable via Prisma schema or active provision route
- Type: Schema gap — values required at runtime but absent from Prisma enum
- Severity: High
- Description: The frontend enum (`types.ts`), shell routing switch (`App.tsx`), WL_ADMIN routing logic, and auth route runtime comments all require `AGGREGATOR` and `WHITE_LABEL` as valid `tenantType` values. However: (1) the Prisma `TenantType` enum does not include these values; (2) the DB `tenant_type` PG type does not include them; (3) the `sync_tenants_to_organizations()` trigger can only copy values from `tenants.type` (Prisma-constrained enum) into `organizations.org_type`; (4) the active provision route (`POST /api/control/tenants/provision`) does not accept a `type` field at all.
- Impact: No current code path can create an AGGREGATOR or WHITE_LABEL tenant through Prisma. Shell routing for these two types — which cover all white-label and aggregator market verticals — is architecturally broken at the data-creation layer.
- Action required: `ALTER TYPE tenant_type ADD VALUE 'AGGREGATOR'; ALTER TYPE tenant_type ADD VALUE 'WHITE_LABEL'` migration, Prisma schema update, backend type alias update, provision route extension. Requires B2-DESIGN decision unit before implementation.
- Classification: High-severity schema gap; core platform functionality (WL tenants) blocked at provisioning layer
- **Partial Remediation (Schema Layer) — 2026-03-09:** B2-REM-1 applied (commit d893524). `AGGREGATOR` added to `TenantType` Prisma enum; `is_white_label BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` added to `tenants` and `organizations`; legacy `WHITE_LABEL` `org_type` organization rows migrated to `B2B` + `is_white_label=true`. Schema layer is now aligned with the canonical model. Remaining open layers: backend serialization (B2-REM-2), frontend enum/routing (B2-REM-3), OpenAPI contract synchronization (B2-REM-4), provisioning flow (B2-REM-5). PW5-V3-DEF-002 is **NOT CLOSED** — partial remediation at schema layer only.

**PW5-V3-DEF-003 — Defect Registration (2026-03-09):**
- ID: PW5-V3-DEF-003
- Title: Backend TenantType alias stale
- Type: Type drift — alias diverges from runtime expectation
- Severity: Low
- Description: `server/src/types/index.ts` declaration: `export type TenantType = 'B2B' | 'B2C' | 'INTERNAL'`. Runtime expectation comment in `server/src/routes/auth.ts` (line 376): `Expected values: 'B2B' | 'WHITE_LABEL' | 'AGGREGATOR' | 'B2C' | null`. The alias does not include `AGGREGATOR` or `WHITE_LABEL` and still includes `INTERNAL`.
- Impact: TypeScript type-checking will not flag AGGREGATOR/WHITE_LABEL values as invalid even though they are not in the alias (they arrive as raw `string` from DB, bypassing the type at the assignment point). Potential future inconsistency when stricter typing is applied.
- Action required: Update alias to match the canonical outcome of B2-DESIGN. Blocked on DEF-002 resolution.
- Classification: Low-severity type drift; does not block runtime but degrades type safety

**PW5-V4 static analysis evidence (2026-03-08):**
- Method: read-only static inspection across all 6 shells — no runtime required
- Files inspected: `layouts/Shells.tsx`, `layouts/SuperAdminShell.tsx`, `App.tsx` (`renderAdminView`, `renderExperienceContent`, WL admin switch), all `components/ControlPlane/` and `components/WhiteLabelAdmin/` panels
- **WORKING (11 EXPERIENCE nav items):** Home, Certifications, Traceability, Orders, DPP Passport, Escrow, Escalations, Settlement, Audit Log, Team, Settings — all wired via `onNavigate*` props → `setExpView` / `setAppState`; all target real, data-connected components
- **WORKING (6 WL_ADMIN views):** BRANDING (`WhiteLabelSettings`), STAFF (`TeamManagement`), PRODUCTS (inline catalog CRUD), COLLECTIONS (`WLCollectionsPanel` → GET `/api/tenant/catalog/items`), ORDERS (`WLOrdersPanel` → GET/PATCH `/api/tenant/orders`), DOMAINS (`WLDomainsPanel` → GET/POST/DELETE `/api/tenant/domains`) — all backend routes confirmed in `server/src/routes/tenant.ts`
- **WORKING (15 SuperAdmin views):** TENANTS, FLAGS, FINANCE, TRADES, CART_SUMMARIES, COMPLIANCE, CASES, ESCALATIONS, CERTIFICATIONS, TRACEABILITY, AI (data), HEALTH, LOGS, EVENTS, RBAC — all render real components with live API calls
- **DEAD NAV (4 items):** B2BShell sidebar: "🤝 Negotiations" (no onClick, no route), "📄 Invoices" (no onClick, no route); WhiteLabelShell nav: "Collections" (no onClick prop), "The Journal" (no onClick prop)
- **DEAD ACTION (7 buttons):** `AdminRBAC` — "Invite Admin" button (no onClick), per-row "Revoke" button (no onClick); `AiGovernance` — "AI Kill Switch" (no onClick), secondary action button(s) (no onClick); `AggregatorShell` header — "Post RFQ" (no onClick); B2B catalog content — "Create RFQ" (no onClick)
- **STATIC/INCORRECT (1):** B2CShell header cart `<span>3</span>` — hardcoded literal, not bound to `useCart().itemCount`; EXPERIENCE overlay `CartToggleButton` is correct but shell's own badge is static
- **PLACEHOLDER_PANEL (5):** `ArchitectureBlueprints`, `BackendSkeleton`, `ApiDocs`, `DataModel`, `MiddlewareScaffold` — all render hardcoded static content; no `useEffect`, no API calls; registered as primary nav destinations in SuperAdminShell
- **STUB (1):** `AdminRBAC` — reads `ADMIN_USERS` constant (hardcoded array from `constants.tsx`), not a live API; action buttons also dead (see above)
- **PARTIAL (1):** `AiGovernance` — live data via `getTenants()` → GET `/api/control/tenants`; but header action buttons have no `onClick` handler
- **UX tranche mapping:** PW5-U1 ← B2C cart badge fix; PW5-U2 ← dead tenant/storefront nav hide-gate (4 items); PW5-U3 ← dead control-plane action hide-gate (7 buttons + AdminRBAC stub); PW5-U4 ← collapse 5 PLACEHOLDER_PANEL nav destinations
- `tsc --noEmit` → TSC_EXIT:0 (no implementation files changed)
- Classification: **VERIFIED** — verification tranche complete (PW5-V1 through PW5-V4 all resolved)

### PW5-W3 Non-Blocking Follow-Up Items — Recorded 2026-03-12

Entries below were recorded during PW5-W3 runtime verification (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-W3-VERIFY-GOV). None block PW5-W3 closure. All are deferred.

---

**PW5-W3-TYPE-ALIGN-001**  
Classification: NON-BLOCKING FOLLOW-UP  
Detected: PW5-W3-VERIFY · 2026-03-12  
Description: Settlement Admin `amount` field type alignment gap. `AdminSettlement.amount` is typed as `number` in `controlPlaneService.ts` but the server serializes the Prisma `Decimal` value via `.toString()`, returning a string. This is runtime-safe because `Intl.NumberFormat.format()` accepts string input in the rendering path. Resolution: align interface to `amount: string` or add `Number()` cast on the server side.  
Status: DEFERRED — non-blocking; no frontend or backend change in this unit.

---

**PW5-W3-TEST-001**  
Classification: NON-BLOCKING FOLLOW-UP  
Detected: PW5-W3-VERIFY · 2026-03-12  
Description: No dedicated integration test exists for `GET /api/control/settlements`. The existing `settlement.g019.integration.test.ts` covers S-001 through S-008 (POST routes only). A `S-009: GET /api/control/settlements returns 200 with paginated list` test case should be added, covering the admin auth guard, cursor pagination, and filter parameters.  
Status: DEFERRED — non-blocking test coverage follow-up; requires future TECS test unit.

---

**PW5-W3-PERF-INDEX**  
Classification: FUTURE PERFORMANCE UNIT  
Detected: PW5-W3-VERIFY · 2026-03-12  
Description: Missing partial compound index on `escrow_transactions` for settlement list cursor pagination. The GET route orders by `(created_at DESC, id DESC)` and uses a compound cursor predicate `(created_at < t) OR (created_at = t AND id < i)`. No `(created_at DESC, id DESC)` index exists on `escrow_transactions` in any applied migration. Existing indexes: `escrow_transactions_tenant_id_idx`, `escrow_transactions_escrow_id_idx`, `escrow_transactions_reference_id_idx` (partial). Recommended index SQL:  
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY escrow_transactions_settlement_list_idx ON public.escrow_transactions (created_at DESC, id DESC) WHERE entry_type = 'RELEASE' AND direction = 'DEBIT';`  
Status: FUTURE PERFORMANCE UNIT — non-blocking at current ledger volume; recommend applying before larger production ledger growth. Requires Prisma migration file + `prisma db pull` + `prisma generate`.

### Planning Tranche (Depends on Verification + UX Tranches)

| ID | Name | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PW5-CP-PLAN | Control-plane re-baseline | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-10 | Read-only architectural baseline established. 17 panels reachable. Route map produced. Capability classification complete. 8 drift observations. 5 new gap entries. Governance sync: PW5-CP-PLAN-GOV. |
| PW5-AI-PLAN | AI/event backbone re-baseline | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 | Read-only planning baseline established. Tenant AI route surface confirmed (GET /api/ai/insights · POST /api/ai/negotiation-advice · GET /api/ai/health). Event backbone confirmed for tenancy/team/marketplace domains. AI event domain absent from registry. Control-plane AI backend design gate preserved (TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE). 9 drift observations registered. Follow-on units proposed: PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN · PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT · PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT · PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY · PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG. Governance sync: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-PLAN. |
| PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN | Register AI event domain (inference + vector) | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE | AI event domain registered. 9 AI event names added to KnownEventName and knownEventEnvelopeSchema. eventSchemas.ts created: 9 Zod payload schemas · EVENT_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS · validateEventPayload(). AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME unchanged. No emitters added. No projections. No routes/RLS/schema changes. validateEventPayload() not yet wired — intentional; not a defect. D-002 CLOSED. Emitter path remains open (PW5-AI-EMITTER). commit dd18957 · typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0 · build EXIT 0. Governance sync: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN. |
| PW5-AI-EMITTER | Wire AI event emission runtime path | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE | Runtime AI event emission wired for approved current trigger points. `server/src/events/aiEmitter.ts` CREATED: `emitAiEventBestEffort()` helper implementing full validated chain (`validateEventPayload()` → `validateKnownEvent()` → `assertNoSecretsInPayload()` → `emitEventToSink()` → `storeEventBestEffort()` where `auditLogId` available); best-effort, non-blocking. `server/src/routes/ai.ts` MODIFIED: `ai.inference.generate` · `ai.inference.error` · `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` wired for both `/api/ai/insights` and `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` success/error/budget paths; success-path events include `auditLogId` for persistence. `server/src/services/ai/ragContextBuilder.ts` MODIFIED: `ai.vector.query` emitted after `querySimilar()` returns (sink-only). AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME NOT modified. No projections, new routes, schema changes, or RLS changes. Persistence gated: success-path inference events persist to `EventLog` (captured `auditLogId` available); error/budget/vector events are sink-only (`EventLog.auditLogId NOT NULL @unique` implementation constraint). Deferred (no concrete synchronous runtime trigger): `ai.vector.upsert` · `ai.vector.delete` · `ai.inference.pii_redacted` · `ai.inference.pii_leak_detected` · `ai.inference.cache_hit`. Follow-on note: degraded-mode `generateContent()` returns `hadInferenceError: false` when Gemini unconfigured — pre-existing upstream behavior; not a defect of this unit. commit 73f0972 · typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0 · build EXIT 0. Governance sync: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-EMITTER. |
| PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT | Extract AI orchestration into Tenant Inference Service boundary | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE | Implementation closure recorded. AI orchestration extracted from `server/src/routes/ai.ts` into `server/src/services/ai/inferenceService.ts` (commit f2ae23b). Route layer now primarily handles auth/context, validation/parsing, service invocation, and response formatting. Preserved behavior: endpoint paths unchanged (`/api/ai/insights` · `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` · `/api/ai/health`), degraded-mode semantics unchanged, reasoning-log + audit-log transaction atomicity preserved, existing AI event emission behavior preserved via existing emitter path, and `ai.vector.query` remains in RAG retrieval path. Explicit non-actions preserved: no route/schema/RLS/event-schema/emitter-semantic widening; no PII/rate-limit/idempotency/caching feature additions. Governance interpretation: D-001 architectural concentration in route layer is materially reduced/resolved by the TIS boundary. Follow-on note (non-defect): static verification + typecheck/lint/build passed; live runtime verification remains pending operational runbook execution due to read-only verification unit scope. Governance sync: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT. |

### PW5-CP-PLAN Architectural Drift Findings — Registered 2026-03-10

Entries below were identified during the PW5-CP-PLAN control-plane architecture re-baseline (read-only analysis, 2026-03-10). All entries are OPEN or DEFERRED with no code change required to register them.

---

**AI_GOV-BACKEND-001**  
Classification: PARTIAL — No Dedicated Backend Route  
Detected: PW5-CP-PLAN · 2026-03-10  
Description: `AiGovernance.tsx` derives AI budget data from `GET /api/control/tenants` (the shared tenants list endpoint) and displays a hardcoded static prompt registry array. No `/api/control/ai/*` route exists in `server/src/routes/`. The panel presents as an AI governance surface but its backend depth is a subset of the Tenants panel. Prompt registry is not persisted or configurable.  
Status: OPEN — design gate; requires product decision on AI governance data model before a backend route can be specified.

---

**RBAC-BACKEND-001**  
Classification: PARTIAL — No Live Backend API  
Detected: PW5-CP-PLAN · 2026-03-10  
Description: `AdminRBAC.tsx` renders exclusively from the `ADMIN_USERS` constant in `constants.tsx`. No `/api/control/rbac/*` or equivalent admin-user management route exists in the backend. Dead mutation buttons were gated in PW5-U3 (commit d5ee430, 2026-03-09) but the fundamental absence of live backend data was not documented in any governance artifact until this entry.  
Status: OPEN — design gate; requires canonical admin-user model decision (Admin table vs JWT-derived) before API surface can be specified.

---

**ESCROW-POST-001**  
Classification: INVESTIGATION REQUIRED — Undocumented Mutation Surface  
Detected: PW5-CP-PLAN · 2026-03-10  
Description: `server/src/routes/control/escrow.g018.ts` line 222 contains a `POST` handler in addition to the two confirmed GET routes (`GET /api/control/escrows` and `GET /api/control/escrows/:escrowId`). This mutation endpoint is not referenced in any frontend consumer, was not mentioned in the PW5-W2 governance closure, and is not documented in `openapi.control-plane.json`. Auth tier and idempotency posture are unverified.  
Status: OPEN — requires inspection of POST handler body to determine: (a) what entity it creates, (b) auth tier (adminAuthMiddleware only vs SUPER_ADMIN preHandler), (c) whether Idempotency-Key enforcement is present.

---

**TRADES-MUTATION-DEFERRED**  
Classification: INTENTIONAL DEFER — Backend-Ready, Frontend Not Wired  
Detected: PW5-CP-PLAN · 2026-03-10  
Description: `server/src/routes/control/trades.g017.ts` implements `POST /api/control/trades/:id/transition` but `TradeOversight.tsx` is strictly read-only per the PW5-W2 wiring tranche constraint. The transition mutation backend is idle from the user's perspective. This intentional deferral existed in code but was not documented in any governance artifact.  
Status: DEFERRED — frontend trade transition UI not yet designed; backend route is implemented and ready. Prerequisite for future wiring: confirm transition body schema, define confirm-before-submit UX pattern consistent with Finance/Compliance/Disputes authority intent pattern.

---

**MAKER-CHECKER-MUTATION-DEFERRED**  
Classification: INTENTIONAL DEFER — Backend-Ready, Frontend Not Wired  
Detected: PW5-CP-PLAN · 2026-03-10  
Description: `server/src/routes/internal/makerChecker.ts` implements `POST /api/control/internal/gov/approvals/:id/sign` and `POST /api/control/internal/gov/approvals/:id/replay` but `MakerCheckerConsole.tsx` exposes only the read surface per the PW5-W4 tranche constraint. Both mutation endpoints require `X-Texqtic-Internal: true` + admin JWT. This intentional deferral existed in code but was not documented in any governance artifact.  
Status: DEFERRED — sign/replay UI wiring deferred to a future TECS unit; backend routes are implemented and ready. Prerequisite: confirm SUPER_ADMIN vs ADMIN role tier for sign/replay; design idempotency-key generation pattern (same as Finance/Compliance authority pattern).

---

**OPENAPI-AI-SCOPE-001**  
Classification: CLOSED / RESOLVED (policy decision)  
Detected: SPEC-SYNC-GOV · 2026-03-10  
Resolved: OPENAPI-POLICY-DECISION-GOV · 2026-03-10  
Description: `/api/ai/insights`, `/api/ai/negotiation-advice`, and `/api/ai/health` currently remain in `openapi.tenant.json` pending explicit contract ownership decision. A dedicated `openapi.ai.json` does not exist in the repository; moving these routes to a non-existent file would create a broken reference. Governance must decide whether these routes belong to the tenant contract, a separate AI-specific contract, or a combined surface.  
Resolution: Retained in `openapi.tenant.json` as tenant-consumable cross-cutting product routes. Placement accepted. Future extraction to a dedicated AI contract remains allowed if AI contract ownership is formally re-baselined in a subsequent unit. No OpenAPI file changes were made in this decision-recording unit.  
Status: ✅ CLOSED — RESOLVED (policy decision) — no product code change, no spec file change.

---

**OPENAPI-IMPERSONATION-DOC-001**  
Classification: CLOSED / RESOLVED (policy decision)  
Detected: SPEC-SYNC-GOV · 2026-03-10  
Resolved: OPENAPI-POLICY-DECISION-GOV · 2026-03-10  
Description: `POST /api/control/impersonation/start` and `POST /api/control/impersonation/stop` are implemented runtime routes (registered in `server/src/routes/admin/impersonation.ts`, prefixed at `/api/control`) but are intentionally absent from `openapi.control-plane.json`. These are SUPER_ADMIN-only endpoints. Governance must decide whether these high-sensitivity endpoints should appear in the public control-plane OpenAPI contract, a restricted internal contract, or remain explicitly undocumented as a policy choice.  
Resolution: Impersonation routes remain intentionally excluded from the public `openapi.control-plane.json`. Their omission is accepted governance policy due to sensitive SUPER_ADMIN operational scope. Route truth is preserved in internal governance and verification artifacts (VER-004, gap-register). No OpenAPI file changes were made in this decision-recording unit.  
Status: ✅ CLOSED — RESOLVED (policy decision) — intentionally excluded from public contract; no product code change, no spec file change.

Verification PASS: typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0 · build EXIT 0. Closure chain: implementation (b1c80da) → static code-path verification → VERIFIED_COMPLETE. Next unit: pending governance prioritization.

### Wave 5 Architecture Block Conditions (Non-Waivable)

Wave 5 architecture sequencing does not begin until all of the following are confirmed in governance:

- [x] **Verification tranche complete** — ✅ MET (2026-03-10) — PW5-V1 ✅ · PW5-V2 ✅ · PW5-V3 ✅ · PW5-V4 ✅ — all four verification units closed with runtime evidence
- [x] **Dead UI gating tranche complete** — ✅ MET (2026-03-10) — PW5-U1 ✅ · PW5-U2 ✅ · PW5-U3 ✅ · PW5-U4 ✅ — all four dead-UI gating units closed
- [x] **Platform wiring truth reconciled in tracker** — ✅ MET (2026-03-10) — PW5-CP-PLAN-GOV governance sync recorded; IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-03.md updated; gap-register wiring/planning tranches updated

No agent, no prompt, and no implementation sprint may bypass these conditions.

### PW5-AI-PLAN Architectural Baseline — Wave 5 AI/Event Backbone Re-Baseline — 2026-03-13

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-PLAN | **Date:** 2026-03-13 | **Type:** Planning Baseline — Read-Only

**Status: ✅ PLANNING COMPLETE — CLOSED AS BASELINE**

This entry records the authoritative Wave 5 AI/event architectural baseline established by the PW5-AI-PLAN planning unit (2026-03-13). No implementation occurred. No governance files, schemas, or routes were modified in this planning unit.

#### A — Tenant-Plane AI Inference Surface (Confirmed Operational)

| Route | File | Auth | Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/ai/insights` | `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | `tenantAuthMiddleware` + `databaseContextMiddleware` | Budget preflight → RAG retrieval → Gemini → usage upsert → reasoning_log + audit_log atomic write |
| `POST /api/ai/negotiation-advice` | `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | `tenantAuthMiddleware` + `databaseContextMiddleware` | Budget preflight → Gemini (no RAG) → usage upsert → reasoning_log + audit_log atomic write |
| `GET /api/ai/health` | `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | `tenantAuthMiddleware` (auth added by commit 960b736) | Provider/model status; no DB context |

- AI orchestration currently concentrated in `server/src/routes/ai.ts` (460 lines) — not yet extracted into dedicated TIS service boundary per G-028 §2.B  
- Model: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash via `@google/generative-ai` SDK  
- Budget enforcement: `aiBudget.ts` (monthly token/cost cap; `BudgetExceededError` → HTTP 429)  
- RAG: `ragContextBuilder.ts` wired into insights route only (G-028 A5)  
- Reasoning audit: G-023 `reasoning_logs` table; SHA-256 hash; atomic write with `audit_logs`  
- Frontend AI calls route through `services/aiService.ts` only; `services/geminiService.ts` deprecated

#### B — Event Backbone (Confirmed Operational; AI Domain Absent)

- Event backbone operational for tenancy/team/marketplace domains (9 `KnownEventName` entries)  
- Projection infrastructure: `events/projections/projector.ts` (functional, idempotent, sequential)  
- `events/handlers/index.ts` imports only one handler: `marketplace.projector.ts`  
- **AI domain events: NOT registered** — `ai.inference.*` / `ai.vector.*` event types are designed in G-028 spec but absent from `KnownEventName` and `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` map  
- No AI-domain event emitters exist anywhere in the codebase

#### C — Control-Plane AI Governance Gate (Preserved Open)

- `TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE` remains **REQUIRES_BACKEND_DESIGN** — not changed by this baseline  
- `AiGovernance.tsx` derives data from `GET /api/control/tenants`; authority action buttons gated/hidden (PW5-U3; commit d5ee430)  
- No dedicated `/api/control/ai/*` route exists  
- G-028 B/C wave (control-plane authority routes: kill switch, model cap, budget write) not started  
- **No control-plane AI implementation begins without an authorized design/execution unit**

#### D — Drift Observations Registered (D-001 through D-009)

| ID | Observation | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| D-001 | TIS not extracted from `ai.ts` monolith; G-028 §2.B intent not yet realized | Medium |
| D-002 | ~~AI domain events absent from `KnownEventName` and `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME`~~ — **CLOSED** — 9 AI event names registered in `KnownEventName` and `knownEventEnvelopeSchema`; `eventSchemas.ts` created (commit dd18957 · PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN · 2026-03-13). `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` not yet mapped (emitter wiring is PW5-AI-EMITTER). | ~~High~~ → **CLOSED (registry layer)** |
| D-003 | `vectorShadowQuery.ts` uses placeholder embedding (explicit TODO; real pipeline available) | Low |
| D-004 | ~~No per-tenant AI rate limiting (60 req/min per G-028 §6.3 spec)~~ — **CLOSED via remediation** — limiter present at TIS boundary with 60 req/min and 60_000ms window; initial verification failure (DEFECT-1 event-behavior leakage) corrected by PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION; rate-limit path is now distinct from budget semantics and no longer emits `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` | ~~Medium~~ → **CLOSED** |
| D-005 | ~~PII redaction pipeline (pre-send + post-receive) not implemented~~ — **CLOSED** — PW5-AI-PII-GUARD (commit b1c80da · 2026-03-14): deterministic `piiGuard.ts` scanner/redactor at TIS boundary; pre-send redaction + post-receive blocking on both AI paths; `ai.inference.pii_redacted` + `ai.inference.pii_leak_detected` confirmed registered; metadata-only payloads; verification PASS | ~~Medium~~ → **CLOSED** |
| D-006 | ~~`idempotency_key` absent from `reasoning_logs` schema (G-028 §3.3 specifies it)~~ — CLOSED via PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY + PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION using request-level idempotency at TIS boundary (`request_id = idem:<key>`), tenant-scoped replay lookup, 24-hour replay window, preserved replay semantics, and restored rate-limit ordering | Closed |
| D-007 | `AiGovernance.tsx` control-plane UI cosmetic; no dedicated AI backend (acknowledged design gate) | Acknowledged |
| D-008 | `GET /api/ai/health` auth-plane ambiguity now resolved (commit 960b736); minor notation retained | Low |
| D-009 | ~~`negotiation-advice` has no RAG injection; diverges from `insights` without documented rationale~~ — **CLOSED** — PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG (commit de202c2): negotiation-advice now calls governed `runRagRetrieval(tx, orgId, prompt)`; retrieved context injected into model prompt via same prepend pattern as insights; insights path unchanged; TIS ordering preserved | Closed |

#### E — Follow-On Units (Proposed; Not Authorized for Implementation)

| Unit ID | One-Line Description | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN | ~~Register `ai.inference.*` and `ai.vector.*` event types in `KnownEventName` + `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME`~~ — **COMPLETE / VERIFIED** — 9 AI event names registered; `eventSchemas.ts` created; `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` not yet mapped (deliberate — emission wiring is PW5-AI-EMITTER); commit dd18957 · 2026-03-13 | ✅ CLOSED |
| ✅ PW5-AI-EMITTER | ~~Wire AI event emission: import `validateEventPayload()`; construct and validate `EventEnvelope`; call `emitEventToSink()` + `storeEventBestEffort()` at authorized AI trigger points~~ — **COMPLETE / VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE** — `aiEmitter.ts` created; `ai.inference.generate` · `ai.inference.error` · `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` live on both AI routes; `ai.vector.query` live in `runRagRetrieval()`; deferred AI events remain open; commit 73f0972 · 2026-03-13 | ✅ CLOSED |
| PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT | Extract AI orchestration from `ai.ts` into dedicated inference service boundary | PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN recommended first |
| ✅ PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT | ~~Implement per-tenant per-minute rate limiting on `/api/ai/*` routes (60 req/min)~~ — initial implementation complete (commit 96ca710) with failed verification due to DEFECT-1 (rate-limit rejection entered budget-exceeded emission path) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED (superseded by remediation) |
| ✅ PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION | Separate rate-limit rejection from budget-exceeded semantics; preserve 429 + `AI_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`; preserve true budget behavior; prevent rate-limit path event emission | ✅ CLOSED / VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE (commit 4b96e13) |
| ✅ PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY | Request-level idempotency implemented at TIS boundary using `request_id = idem:<key>` tenant-scoped 24-hour replay; initial verification failed due to replay-before-rate-limit ordering defect | ✅ IMPLEMENTED (superseded by remediation) |

| PW5-AI-PII-GUARD | Add pre-send and post-receive PII detection/redaction controls at TIS boundary; address D-005 | PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG recommended first |
| ✅ PW5-G028-B1-CATALOG-INDEXER | ~~Auto-index catalog item mutations via `enqueueVectorIndexJob()`~~ — **COMPLETE / VERIFIED_COMPLETE** — catalog create mutation (`POST /api/tenant/catalog/items`) now enqueues vector indexing via `enqueueSourceIngestion()` post-commit; existing A6 async backbone reused; `orgId` server-derived; no inline embedding; create-path only; verification PASS; commit b3ffd18 · 2026-03-15 | ✅ CLOSED / VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| PW5-G028-C-CONTROL-PLANE-AI | `PUT /api/control/ai-budget/:tenantId`, kill switch, model cap routes | Explicit design authorization + TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE gate |
| PW5-SHADOW-QUERY-FIX | Replace placeholder embedding in `vectorShadowQuery.ts` with real `generateEmbedding()` | Low urgency |

**None of the above units are authorized for implementation by this baseline entry. Each requires a separate authorized execution unit.**

### PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION — Defect Closure Record — CLOSED 2026-03-14

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION | **Date:** 2026-03-14 | **Type:** Remediation + Verification Closure

**Verification result:** VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE

**Atomic remediation commit:** 4b96e13 — `fix(ai): separate rate-limit rejection from budget-exceeded emission`

#### Corrected Defect

- DEFECT-1: initial PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT implementation caused `AiRateLimitExceededError` to flow through budget-exceeded handling and emit `ai.inference.budget_exceeded`.

#### Corrected Final State

- Rate-limit rejection is now distinct from budget exhaustion semantics.
- Rate-limited requests return HTTP 429 with `error: "AI_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"`.
- Rate-limited requests no longer emit `ai.inference.generate`, `ai.inference.error`, or `ai.inference.budget_exceeded`.
- True budget exhaustion behavior is preserved for real `BudgetExceededError`.
- Rate-limit values remain unchanged: 60 requests per tenant per minute, 60_000ms window.

#### Explicit Non-Actions

- No Prisma/schema changes.
- No event schema changes.
- No new event names.
- No emitter definition changes.
- No route-path changes.
- No governance edits were performed during runtime implementation units.

#### Verification Note (Non-Defect)

- Verification completed through static code-path inspection.
- No live runtime probe was introduced in the read-only verification unit.
- This is recorded as a follow-on evidence note, not a failure condition.

#### Governance Implication

- `PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT` is effectively CLOSED via remediation.
- Request-frequency drift D-004 is now governance-closed.
- Future enhancements remain separate units.
- **Next proposed unit:** `PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY` (not implemented; not authorized by this record).

### PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG — Implementation + Verification Closure — CLOSED 2026-03-14

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG | **Date:** 2026-03-14 | **Type:** Implementation + Verification Closure

**Verification result:** VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE

**Implementation commit:** de202c2 — `feat(ai): add RAG retrieval to negotiation advice`

#### What This Unit Accomplished

- The negotiation-advice path inside TIS (`server/src/services/ai/inferenceService.ts`) now calls the same governed retrieval helper used by insights: `runRagRetrieval(tx, orgId, prompt)` — imported from `./ragContextBuilder.js`. No duplication; no alternative path.
- Retrieved context is injected into the actual prompt sent to the model using the same prepend pattern as insights: `${ragResult.contextBlock}\n\n${prompt}`.
- Fallback to original `prompt` when retrieval is unavailable (feature flag off, error, or no context returned).
- Latency instrumentation applied consistently: `startTimer` / `markRetrievalStart` / `recordRetrievalLatency` / `markInferenceStart` / `recordInferenceLatency` / `recordTotalLatency` — consistent with insights path.
- `reasoningHash`, `promptSummary`, and other prompt-derived stored artifacts now reflect the actual final prompt sent to the model (previously reflected only the base prompt).

#### Preserved Behavior

- `ai.vector.query` continues to originate from the retrieval layer (`ragContextBuilder.ts`) and was not reimplemented in TIS.
- Established TIS execution order fully preserved: rate limit → idempotency replay → RAG retrieval → model invocation → reasoning/audit log creation → post-transaction event emission.
- Insights path (`if (taskType === 'insights')` branch) structurally identical and unchanged.
- Route contracts unchanged: `/api/ai/negotiation-advice`, `/api/ai/insights`, `/api/ai/health`.
- Existing event semantics, rate-limit semantics, idempotency semantics, and degraded-mode semantics all unchanged.

#### Explicit Non-Actions

- No Prisma/schema changes.
- No event schema changes.
- No new event names.
- No emitter definition changes.
- No rate-limit logic changes.
- No idempotency logic changes.
- No route-path changes.
- No governance edits were performed during runtime implementation units.

#### Verification Note (Non-Defect)

- Verification completed through static code-path inspection.
- No live runtime probe was introduced in the read-only verification unit.
- Live vector-flag / retrieval round-trip confirmation remains an operational follow-on, not a failure condition.
- This is consistent with the verification convention established for PW5-AI-EMITTER, PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT, PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION, and PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION.

#### Governance Implication

- `PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG` is CLOSED with verification state recorded.
- D-009 is now closed: negotiation-advice uses the governed retrieval backbone.
- Negotiation and insights now share the governed `runRagRetrieval()` retrieval pattern at the TIS layer.
- Future negotiation AI enhancements remain separate work, not part of this closure.
- **Next proposed unit:** `PW5-AI-PII-GUARD` — add PII detection/redaction controls at TIS boundary; addresses D-005 (proposed only; not implemented, not authorized by this record).

### PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION — Defect Closure Record — CLOSED 2026-03-14

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION | **Date:** 2026-03-14 | **Type:** Remediation + Verification Closure

**Verification result:** VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE

**Atomic remediation commit:** 536fe50 — `fix(ai): apply rate limiting before idempotent replay`

#### Corrected Defect

- Initial PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY implementation allowed replay return before tenant rate-limit enforcement.
- That ordering changed the authoritative semantics of PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT.

#### Corrected Final State

- TIS ordering is now: normalize idempotency key → enforce tenant rate limit → replay lookup.
- Replay hit now returns only after rate-limit enforcement.
- Replay behavior preserved: stored logical result returned; no Gemini/model invocation; no new reasoning-log creation; no new audit-log creation; no inference event re-emission.
- 24-hour replay logic remains intact.
- Idempotency-Key route/header contract remains unchanged.
- First-execution transactional reasoning/audit flow and post-transaction inference event emission remain unchanged.
- Rate-limit values remain unchanged: 60 requests per tenant per minute, 60_000ms window.

#### Explicit Non-Actions

- No Prisma/schema changes.
- No event schema changes.
- No new event names.
- No emitter definition changes.
- No route-path changes.
- No rate-limit value changes.
- No governance edits were performed during runtime implementation units.

#### Verification Note (Non-Defect)

- Verification completed through static code-path inspection.
- No live runtime probe was introduced in the read-only verification unit.
- This is recorded as a follow-on evidence note, not a failure condition.

#### Governance Implication

- `PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION` is CLOSED with verification state recorded.
- `PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY` is effectively CLOSED via remediation.
- Corrected idempotency behavior is now authoritative in governance.
- Future idempotency enhancements remain separate work, not part of this closure.
- **Next proposed unit:** `PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG` (proposed only; not implemented, not authorized by this record).

### PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN — AI Event Domain Registration — CLOSED 2026-03-13

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN | **Date:** 2026-03-13 | **Type:** Implementation + Verification Closure

**Verification result:** VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE

**Commit:** dd18957 — `feat(events): register AI event domain (inference + vector)`

#### What This Unit Accomplished

| Artifact | Change |
|---|---|
| `server/src/lib/events.ts` | `KnownEventName` union extended with 9 AI event names; `knownEventEnvelopeSchema` Zod enum extended with same 9 names |
| `server/src/events/eventSchemas.ts` | NEW — 9 Zod payload schemas (`AiInferenceGeneratePayload` through `AiVectorQueryPayload`); `EVENT_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS` registry; `validateEventPayload()` helper |

#### AI Event Names Registered

Inference domain: `ai.inference.generate` · `ai.inference.error` · `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` · `ai.inference.pii_redacted` · `ai.inference.pii_leak_detected` · `ai.inference.cache_hit`

Vector domain: `ai.vector.upsert` · `ai.vector.delete` · `ai.vector.query`

#### What This Unit Explicitly Did NOT Do

- ❌ Did not emit AI events
- ❌ Did not modify `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME`
- ❌ Did not add AI projections or event consumers
- ❌ Did not modify routes, RLS, Prisma schema, or migration files
- ❌ Did not wire `validateEventPayload()` into runtime emission path (intentional — not a defect)
- ❌ Did not modify `ai.ts`

#### Follow-On Note (Preserved)

`validateEventPayload()` exists in `eventSchemas.ts` and is not currently imported or called anywhere in the runtime. This is intentional per unit boundary. AI event emission remains a separate TECS unit: **PW5-AI-EMITTER**.

#### Validation Gates

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm typecheck` | ✅ PASS — zero errors |
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ PASS — 0 errors; 108 pre-existing warnings; no warnings in changed files |
| `pnpm build` | ✅ PASS — zero errors |

**Status: PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN ✅ CLOSED — 2026-03-13 — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN**

**D-002 GAP STATUS: CLOSED (registry layer complete) — emitter path now also CLOSED (PW5-AI-EMITTER ✅ COMPLETE)**

**Next proposed unit: PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT — extract AI orchestration into dedicated inference service boundary**

### PW5-AI-EMITTER — AI Event Emission Runtime Wiring — CLOSED 2026-03-13

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-EMITTER | **Date:** 2026-03-13 | **Type:** Implementation + Verification Closure

**Verification result:** VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE

**Commit:** 73f0972 — `feat(events): wire AI event emission runtime path`

#### What This Unit Accomplished

| Artifact | Change |
|---|---|
| `server/src/events/aiEmitter.ts` | NEW — `emitAiEventBestEffort()` helper: full validated emission chain; best-effort, non-blocking; `AiEventOpts` interface (`orgId`, `actorId?`, `timestamp?`, `auditLogId?`, `prisma?`) |
| `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | MODIFIED — import added; `generateContent()` return type extended with `hadInferenceError: boolean`; `auditLog.id` captured from committed tx; `ai.inference.generate` / `ai.inference.error` / `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` wired on both routes |
| `server/src/services/ai/ragContextBuilder.ts` | MODIFIED — import added; `ai.vector.query` emitted after `querySimilar()` returns |

#### Trigger Points Wired

| Route / Path | Event Emitted | Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/ai/insights` success path | `ai.inference.generate` | ✅ persists (auditLogId captured) |
| `/api/ai/insights` inference failure | `ai.inference.error` | sink-only |
| `/api/ai/insights` budget rejection | `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` | sink-only |
| `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` success path | `ai.inference.generate` | ✅ persists (auditLogId captured) |
| `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` inference failure | `ai.inference.error` | sink-only |
| `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` budget rejection | `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` | sink-only |
| `runRagRetrieval()` vector query path | `ai.vector.query` | sink-only |

#### Emission Chain Confirmed

`validateEventPayload()` → build `EventEnvelope` (randomUUID, v1, entity=`orgId`, realm=TENANT, actor=SYSTEM) → `validateKnownEvent()` → `assertNoSecretsInPayload()` → `emitEventToSink()` → `storeEventBestEffort()` (gated on `auditLogId + prisma`)

#### Persistence Boundary

`EventLog.auditLogId NOT NULL @unique` FK to `AuditLog` is an implementation constraint. Only routes that create an `AuditLog` row inside a committed transaction have a valid `auditLogId` to pass. Error paths and RAG retrieval fire outside a committed audit-log context — sink-only is correct, not a regression.

#### What This Unit Explicitly Did NOT Do

- ❌ Did not modify `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME`
- ❌ Did not add AI projections or event consumers
- ❌ Did not add new routes
- ❌ Did not change Prisma schema or RLS
- ❌ Did not wire `ai.vector.upsert` or `ai.vector.delete` (async queue path — no concrete sync trigger)
- ❌ Did not wire `ai.inference.pii_redacted`, `ai.inference.pii_leak_detected`, or `ai.inference.cache_hit` (no active runtime implementations)
- ❌ Did not implement control-plane AI governance

#### Deferred Items (Intentional — No Approved Runtime Trigger)

| Event Name | Reason Deferred |
|---|---|
| `ai.vector.upsert` | Gated behind async in-process queue (`vectorIndexQueue.ts`); no synchronous trigger available |
| `ai.vector.delete` | Same as above |
| `ai.inference.pii_redacted` | No active PII redaction pipeline in codebase |
| `ai.inference.pii_leak_detected` | No active PII detection pipeline in codebase |
| `ai.inference.cache_hit` | No inference caching implementation in codebase |

#### Follow-On Note (Preserved from Verification)

When `genAI` is null (Gemini SDK unconfigured), `generateContent()` returns a degraded text response with `hadInferenceError: false`. As a result, the success path emits `ai.inference.generate` even for a no-op fallback. This is pre-existing upstream behavior and was not introduced by PW5-AI-EMITTER. Correcting this requires a separate scoped unit (likely within PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT). This note does not reopen PW5-AI-EMITTER or convert it to a failed unit.

#### Validation Gates

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm typecheck` | ✅ PASS — zero errors |
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ PASS — 0 errors; 108 pre-existing warnings; no warnings in changed files |
| `pnpm build` | ✅ PASS — zero errors |

**Status: PW5-AI-EMITTER ✅ CLOSED — 2026-03-13 — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-EMITTER**

**Runtime AI emission gap: CLOSED for current trigger coverage — deferred AI event types remain open**

**Next proposed unit: PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT — extract AI orchestration into dedicated inference service boundary**
