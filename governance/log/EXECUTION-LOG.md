## Log Schema

Each entry uses this structure (defined by GOV-OS-001 Section 3.5, extended per GOV-OS-006):

```
### <UNIT-ID> — <YYYY-MM-DD>
Type: <unit type>
Status: <terminal status>
Commit: <SHA> | N/A
Title: <one-line title>
Summary: <≤3 sentences: what was done, what changed, what was closed>
Layer Impact: <which layers had truth updated>
Notes: <constraints or cautions applicable after closure>
Refs: <canonical reference path>
```

`Layer Impact` values:
- `Layer 0` — control-plane files updated (`governance/control/`)
- `Layer 1` — unit record files added or updated (`governance/units/`)
- `Layer 2` — decision records added or updated (`governance/decisions/`)
- `Layer 3` — execution log updated (this file)
- `Historical only` — closure predates Governance OS; reflected only in legacy trackers
  or in Layer 0 closed-baseline, not in a new-style unit record

---

## Completed Governance Milestones

Entries are ordered chronologically by closure date. Oldest first.
Do not insert new entries above the horizontal rule marking the most recent entry.

### TECS-FBW-012 — pre-2026-03-17
Type: IMPLEMENTATION
Status: CLOSED
Commit: N/A (pre-Governance-OS closure; exact SHA in legacy tracker)
Title: Trades tenant panel — Wave closure (product unit)
Summary: TECS-FBW-012 was closed as VERIFIED_COMPLETE prior to the installation of the
  Governance OS (before GOV-OS-002). Its closure is recorded in the legacy implementation
  tracker and was reflected in the Layer 0 closed baseline established at GOV-OS-002. No
  new-style Layer 1 unit record exists — this unit predates GOV-OS-003.
Layer Impact: Historical only — closure occurred before Governance OS was installed; captured
  in Layer 0 closed baseline at GOV-OS-002 (governance/control/SNAPSHOT.md, OPEN-SET.md)
Notes: No Layer 1 unit record. Do not reopen. Closure details preserved in
  docs/governance/IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-03.md (legacy secondary reference).
  This entry records the fact of closure without reinterpreting pre-Governance-OS history.

### GOV-OS-001 — 2026-03-17
Type: GOVERNANCE / DESIGN
Status: CLOSED
Commit: 91031f0
Title: Governance Control-Plane Partition Design
Summary: Designed the TexQtic Governance OS with five structurally separated layers (Layer 0–4),
  rigid status vocabulary (7 statuses), legal state transition rules, enforcement model, and
  phased migration plan. No application code changed; no product unit status changed.
  This unit is the permanent design authority for all Governance OS units.
Layer Impact: Historical only — design artifact created at docs/governance/control/GOV-OS-001-DESIGN.md;
  no Layer 0 control-plane files existed yet at time of closure
Notes: GOV-OS-001-DESIGN.md is the design authority. Do not modify it.
  All future Governance OS units trace their schema authority to this document.

### GOV-OS-002 — 2026-03-17
Type: GOVERNANCE / BOOTSTRAP
Status: CLOSED
Commit: 1c0669c
Title: Governance Control-Plane Bootstrap (Layer 0)
Summary: Created and populated all five Layer 0 control-plane files — DOCTRINE.md, OPEN-SET.md,
  NEXT-ACTION.md, BLOCKED.md, SNAPSHOT.md — in governance/control/. Established controlled
  status vocabulary, canonical open set of 5 product units, and carry-forward context protocol.
  No application code changed; no product unit status was changed.
Layer Impact: Layer 0 — governance/control/ directory installed;
  all five control-plane files created for the first time
Notes: This unit is the Layer 0 bootstrap authority. The five control-plane files are now
  the primary operational truth for all governance workflows. Archive-scale legacy documents
  remain preserved but are no longer first-read operational truth.

### GOV-OS-003 — 2026-03-17
Type: GOVERNANCE / MIGRATION
Status: CLOSED
Commit: 190936f
Title: Unit Record Migration Batch 1 (Layer 1)
Summary: Created Layer 1 unit record files for the five open product residuals —
  TECS-FBW-002-B, TECS-FBW-003-B, TECS-FBW-006-B, TECS-FBW-013, TECS-FBW-ADMINRBAC —
  plus a README index in governance/units/. Each unit received a canonical YAML-frontmatter
  record capturing status, blockers, and decisions_required. No application code changed.
Layer Impact: Layer 1 — governance/units/ directory installed;
  5 unit record files + README created
Notes: GOV-OS governance units (001–006) do not have Layer 1 unit records. Only the five
  open product residuals were migrated in this batch. This is intentional per GOV-OS-001 design.
  Closed product units (Wave 0–5 except residuals) predate Layer 1 and have no unit records.

### GOV-OS-004 — 2026-03-17
Type: GOVERNANCE / SYNC
Status: CLOSED
Commit: 84e5bb8
Title: Control-Plane Sync After Unit Record Migration
Summary: Synced Layer 0 control-plane files to reflect Layer 1 installation. NEXT-ACTION.md
  advanced to GOV-OS-005 (Decision Ledger Bootstrap). SNAPSHOT.md updated with
  layer_1_installed: true and carry-forward session context. Minimal-scope sync; no new
  files created.
Layer Impact: Layer 0 — NEXT-ACTION.md and SNAPSHOT.md updated
Notes: Control-plane sync units are CLOSED on completion without separate verification.
  Sync units do not change product unit statuses.

### GOV-OS-005 — 2026-03-17
Type: GOVERNANCE / BOOTSTRAP
Status: VERIFIED_COMPLETE
Commit: 15b3276 (decision ledger bootstrap) · 481b8e0 (VERIFIED_COMPLETE control-plane record)
Title: Decision Ledger Bootstrap (Layer 2)
Summary: Created Layer 2 decision ledger — governance/decisions/ — with README,
  PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md, DESIGN-DECISIONS.md, and SECURITY-DECISIONS.md. Recorded 5 canonical
  gate decision IDs (all Status: OPEN). Advanced NEXT-ACTION to GOV-OS-006. Accepted by
  operator as VERIFIED_COMPLETE on same date.
Layer Impact: Layer 2 — governance/decisions/ directory installed; 4 files created;
  Layer 0 — SNAPSHOT.md updated (layer_2_installed: true, last_unit_closed: GOV-OS-005)
Notes: All 5 gate decisions remain Status: OPEN — none are DECIDED. No product implementation
  is authorized by the presence of placeholder decision entries. Vocabulary separation
  enforced by operator directive (2026-03-17): unit status vocabulary ≠ decision status
  vocabulary. TECS-FBW-002-B has no decision entry — its blocker is a technical dependency,
  not a gate decision. This distinction is preserved.

### GOV-OS-006 — 2026-03-17
Type: GOVERNANCE / BOOTSTRAP
Status: CLOSED
Commit: 2bc6e62
Title: Execution Log Bootstrap (Layer 3)
Summary: Created Layer 3 execution log — governance/log/ — with README and this
  EXECUTION-LOG.md. Populated the log with canonical historical entries for all completed
  governance milestones (TECS-FBW-012 pre-OS closure, GOV-OS-001 through GOV-OS-006).
  Advanced NEXT-ACTION to GOV-OS-007 (Archive Migration). No application code changed.
Layer Impact: Layer 3 — governance/log/ directory installed; README.md and EXECUTION-LOG.md
  created; Layer 0 — NEXT-ACTION.md and SNAPSHOT.md updated (layer_3_installed: true)
Notes: The execution log is append-only after this bootstrap. All future closed units must
  append one entry to this file. Layer 3 is historical context — not operational truth.
  Layer 4 (archive migration) remains not yet installed.
