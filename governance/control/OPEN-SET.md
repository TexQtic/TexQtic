## Layer 0 Role

- Layer 0 confirms current governed-unit state, blocker/hold posture, audit posture, and
  governance exceptions.
- Layer 0 does not originate ordinary product delivery sequencing.
- Ordinary product sequencing is read from the product-truth authority stack listed below.

## Control-Plane Read Order

1. `governance/control/OPEN-SET.md`
2. `governance/control/NEXT-ACTION.md`
3. `governance/control/BLOCKED.md`
4. `governance/control/SNAPSHOT.md` only when restore context or historical ambiguity matters

## Operating Notes

- Governing posture: `HOLD-FOR-BOUNDARY-TIGHTENING` remains in effect.
- One product-facing `ACTIVE_DELIVERY` unit is now open: `PUBLIC_B2C_BROWSE_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE`.
- Opening basis: explicit human decision by Paresh (2026-04-22) after two mandatory pre-opening gates:
  (1) final readiness reassessment concluded `READY_FOR_HUMAN_OPENING_DECISION`
  (`TEXQTIC-B2C-PUBLIC-BROWSE-FINAL-READINESS-REASSESSMENT-v1.md`, commit `3ad5417`);
  (2) WL Co slice-3 compatibility reassessment concluded `WL_CO_NON_BLOCKING_CONFIRMED_FOR_B2C_SLICE3`
  (`TEXQTIC-WL-CO-B2C-SLICE3-COMPATIBILITY-REASSESSMENT-v1.md`, commit `1f01a84`).
- Primary design authority for the active unit: `governance/decisions/TEXQTIC-PUBLIC-DOWNSTREAM-PAGE-ARCHITECTURE-AND-SCOPE-DECISION-v1.md`.
- Scope: add `PUBLIC_B2C_BROWSE` AppState to `App.tsx`; build `components/Public/B2CBrowsePage.tsx`;
  add render case; upgrade B2C CTAs from scroll to `setAppState('PUBLIC_B2C_BROWSE')` state transition.
  Use the already-live `GET /api/public/b2c/products` endpoint. Does NOT include schema changes, data
  changes, WL Co seam advancement, backend route changes, or work outside the four bounded deliverables.
- Prior governance slices `B2C_PUBLIC_FINAL_READINESS_REASSESSMENT_SLICE` (commit `3ad5417`) and
  `B2C_WL_CO_SLICE3_COMPATIBILITY_REASSESSMENT_SLICE` (commit `1f01a84`) are closed as pre-opening gates.
- `PUBLIC_B2B_DISCOVERY_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE` closed `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` (commit `04dc375`, 2026-04-22).
  All three bounded deliverables confirmed: `PUBLIC_B2B_DISCOVERY` AppState in `App.tsx`; B2B
  discovery page component (`components/Public/B2BDiscovery.tsx`); homepage B2B CTAs upgraded from
  temporary scroll behavior to `setAppState('PUBLIC_B2B_DISCOVERY')` state transition.
- `PUBLIC_B2C_PROJECTION_PRECONDITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE` closed `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` (commit `7baf50a`, 2026-04-22).
  Three deliverables confirmed: `server/src/services/publicB2CProjection.service.ts` (5-gate B2C projection
  service); `GET /api/public/b2c/products` registered in `server/src/routes/public.ts`; 10/10 unit tests passing.
- `B2C_PUBLIC_DATA_POSTURE_ASSIGNMENT_SLICE` closed `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` (commit `6dbc5e9`, 2026-04-22).
  `qa-b2c` tenant (`isWhiteLabel:false`) assigned `publicEligibilityPosture=PUBLICATION_ELIGIBLE`,
  org `publication_posture=B2C_PUBLIC`, all three catalog items `publicationPosture=B2C_PUBLIC`.
  `GET /api/public/b2c/products` confirmed returning one truthful non-placeholder B2C result (HTTP 200).
  Image URLs preserved (zero drift). No WL-parented tenants touched.
- D-016 posture: **INACTIVE** — one active product-delivery unit open by explicit human decision.
- D-015 post-close authority reconciliation: complete (2026-04-22).
- D-013 carry-forward result: `SUCCESSOR_CHAIN_PRESERVED`.
  D-020 artifact: `governance/decisions/TEXQTIC-PUBLIC-MARKET-ACCESS-FAMILY-SUCCESSOR-CHAIN-D020-v1.md`.
- All prior product-delivery units (`PUBLIC_B2B_PROJECTION_PRECONDITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE`,
  `PUBLIC_B2B_DISCOVERY_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE`, `PUBLIC_B2C_PROJECTION_PRECONDITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE`,
  and `B2C_PUBLIC_DATA_POSTURE_ASSIGNMENT_SLICE`) are closed. Their design authorities remain
  locked historical evidence only.
- Planning-package recommendations outside the product-truth authority stack remain guidance and
  decision input only, not live authority.
- Preserved aligned anchors, including the closed onboarding-family handoff chain, remain outside
  the live canon package and outside the live control set.
- The old `-v2` chain remains historical evidence and reconciliation input only.
