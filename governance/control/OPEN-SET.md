# OPEN-SET.md — Layer 0 Governed Posture and Read Order

**Layer:** 0 — Control Plane  
**Authority:** governance/control/TEXQTIC-OPENING-LAYER-GOVERNANCE-AUTHORITY-AND-POINTER-LAYER-2026-04-10.md

## Layer 0 Role

- Layer 0 confirms current governed-unit state, blocker/hold posture, audit posture, and
  governance exceptions.
- Layer 0 does not originate ordinary product delivery sequencing.
- Ordinary product sequencing is read from the product-truth authority stack listed below.

## Control-Plane Read Order

1. `governance/control/OPEN-SET.md`
2. `governance/control/NEXT-ACTION.md`
3. `governance/control/BLOCKED.md`
4. `governance/control/SNAPSHOT.md` only when restore context or historical ambiguity matters

## Operating Notes

- Governing posture: `HOLD-FOR-BOUNDARY-TIGHTENING` remains in effect.
- TECS-B2B-BUYER-CATALOG-BROWSE-001 Phase 1 is VERIFIED_WITH_NON-BLOCKING_NOTES (2026-05-08).
  Verification artifact: docs/TECS-B2B-BUYER-CATALOG-BROWSE-001-VERIFICATION-v1.md.
  All static gates passed. Runtime API checks pending production verification.
- TECS-B2B-BUYER-CATALOG-SUPPLIER-SELECT-001 Phase 2 route binding fix is IMPLEMENTED_PENDING_RUNTIME_REVALIDATION (2026-04-23).
  Implementation artifact: docs/TECS-B2B-BUYER-CATALOG-ROUTE-BINDING-FIX-001-v1.md.
  Fix: buyer_catalog stateBinding changed to { expView: 'BUYER_CATALOG' }; 'BUYER_CATALOG' added to EXPERIENCE_VIEWS.
  Files: runtime/sessionRuntimeDescriptor.ts · App.tsx.
  Required next step: deploy to production, run follow-up production runtime validation pass.
  NB-001, NB-002, NB-003 from prior verification artifacts remain unlifted until validation PASS.
  Combined buyer-side B2B governance closure remains deferred. Requires explicit user instruction.
- Layer 0 posture: `ACTIVE_DELIVERY` (Phase 2 unit open, pending verification).
  The next opening is a human decision; no unit may be inferred from the closed unit, family
  proximity, or stale carry-forward wording.
- Prior governance slices `B2C_PUBLIC_FINAL_READINESS_REASSESSMENT_SLICE` (commit `3ad5417`) and
  `B2C_WL_CO_SLICE3_COMPATIBILITY_REASSESSMENT_SLICE` (commit `1f01a84`) are closed as pre-opening gates.
- `PUBLIC_B2B_DISCOVERY_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE` closed `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` (commit `04dc375`, 2026-04-22).
  All three bounded deliverables confirmed: `PUBLIC_B2B_DISCOVERY` AppState in `App.tsx`; B2B
  discovery page component (`components/Public/B2BDiscovery.tsx`); homepage B2B CTAs upgraded from
  temporary scroll behavior to `setAppState('PUBLIC_B2B_DISCOVERY')` state transition.
- `PUBLIC_B2C_PROJECTION_PRECONDITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE` closed `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` (commit `7baf50a`, 2026-04-22).
  Three deliverables confirmed: `server/src/services/publicB2CProjection.service.ts` (5-gate B2C projection
  service); `GET /api/public/b2c/products` registered in `server/src/routes/public.ts`; 10/10 unit tests passing.
- `B2C_PUBLIC_DATA_POSTURE_ASSIGNMENT_SLICE` closed `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` (commit `6dbc5e9`, 2026-04-22).
  `qa-b2c` tenant (`isWhiteLabel:false`) assigned `publicEligibilityPosture=PUBLICATION_ELIGIBLE`,
  org `publication_posture=B2C_PUBLIC`, all three catalog items `publicationPosture=B2C_PUBLIC`.
  `GET /api/public/b2c/products` confirmed returning one truthful non-placeholder B2C result (HTTP 200).
  Image URLs preserved (zero drift). No WL-parented tenants touched.
- `PUBLIC_B2C_BROWSE_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE` closed `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` (commits `34a6f84` + `d78fa79`, 2026-04-22).
  All four bounded deliverables confirmed: `PUBLIC_B2C_BROWSE` AppState in `App.tsx`; B2C browse page
  component (`components/Public/B2CBrowsePage.tsx`); `case 'PUBLIC_B2C_BROWSE'` render case in App.tsx;
  all B2C CTAs upgraded from `selectNeutralPublicEntryPath('B2C')` scroll to
  `setAppState('PUBLIC_B2C_BROWSE')` state transition. Closure basis: production verification
  `VERIFIED_PRODUCTION_PASS` at `https://app.texqtic.com/`. In-scope production wording fix applied
  in `d78fa79`. Runtime, schema, and data unchanged throughout.
- D-016 posture: **ACTIVE** — zero active product-delivery units; decision control required per D-016.
- D-015 post-close authority reconciliation: complete (2026-04-22).
- D-013 carry-forward result: `SUCCESSOR_CHAIN_PRESERVED`.
  D-020 artifact: `governance/decisions/TEXQTIC-PUBLIC-MARKET-ACCESS-FAMILY-SUCCESSOR-CHAIN-D020-v1.md`.
- All prior product-delivery units (`PUBLIC_B2B_PROJECTION_PRECONDITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE`,
  `PUBLIC_B2B_DISCOVERY_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE`, `PUBLIC_B2C_PROJECTION_PRECONDITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE`,
  `B2C_PUBLIC_DATA_POSTURE_ASSIGNMENT_SLICE`, and `PUBLIC_B2C_BROWSE_IMPLEMENTATION_SLICE`) are closed.
  Their design authorities remain locked historical evidence only.
- Planning-package recommendations outside the product-truth authority stack remain guidance and
  decision input only, not live authority.
- Preserved aligned anchors, including the closed onboarding-family handoff chain, remain outside
  the live canon package and outside the live control set.
- The old `-v2` chain remains historical evidence and reconciliation input only.
