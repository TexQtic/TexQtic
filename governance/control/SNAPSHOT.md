  TECS-B2B-BUYER-CATALOG-BROWSE-001 Phase 1 — authenticated B2B buyer catalog browse.
  Verification verdict: VERIFIED_WITH_NON-BLOCKING_NOTES (2026-05-08).
  Verification artifact: docs/TECS-B2B-BUYER-CATALOG-BROWSE-001-VERIFICATION-v1.md.
  Implementation commits: 99d1b1d (7-file implementation) + 61cb3db (TS2322 production hotfix).
  All static gates passed (server typecheck: 6 pre-existing errors only; frontend tsc: 0 errors;
  lint: 0 errors, 164 pre-existing warnings). Runtime API checks pending production verification.
  Authorized by PRODUCT-DEC-BUYER-CATALOG-DISCOVERY-001.md.
  Backend: GET /api/tenant/catalog/supplier/:supplierOrgId/items with dual eligibility gate,
    texqtic_rfq_read cross-tenant read, cursor pagination, no price in response.
  Frontend: buyer_catalog route case in App.tsx, BuyerCatalog state/handler, RFQ continuity preserved.
  Runtime descriptor: buyer_catalog route in b2b_workspace catalog_browse group, buyerCatalog=true capability.
  Schema unchanged. No new dependencies. No out-of-scope files modified.
  Phase 2 items (supplier selection UX, per-item posture filtering, catalog search) explicitly deferred.
  Layer 0 returns to zero-open posture.
```

## Current Posture

- Layer 0 confirms governed posture, blocker/hold posture, audit posture, and governance
  exceptions only.
- Ordinary product execution sequencing is read from the product-truth authority stack.
- The recreated 2026-04-10 governance authority/pointer surface and sequencing surface remain live
  control inputs.
- Closed onboarding-family chains remain preserved aligned anchors only.
- `White Label Co` remains the sole `REVIEW-UNKNOWN` hold.

## Restore Notes

- Read `OPEN-SET.md`, `NEXT-ACTION.md`, and `BLOCKED.md` first, in that order.
- Use this file only when current opening-layer context is missing or historically ambiguous.
- Subscription slice 3C is implemented, VERIFIED_CLEAN, and closed; no product-facing implementation unit is currently open.
