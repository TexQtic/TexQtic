## Active Blockers

*(None — BLK-FBW-002-B-001 resolved 2026-03-17; see BLOCKED.md Section 4)*

## Active Design Gates

- **TECS-FBW-ADMINRBAC** — Requires explicit product + security decision before any work

## Closed Baseline (must not be reopened)

| Group | Status |
|---|---|
| Wave 0–5 (all FBW units except residuals above) | ALL CLOSED |
| WL storefront tranche (PW5-WL1–7) | ALL CLOSED |
| Auth remediation chain (TECS-FBW-AUTH-001–003 etc.) | ALL CLOSED |
| G-028 slices C1–C6 | ALL VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| Pre-Wave-5 remediation (PW5-V1–V4, PW5-U1–U3) | ALL CLOSED / PASS |
| GOV-OS-001 | CLOSED |
| GOV-OS-002 | CLOSED |
| GOV-OS-003 | CLOSED |
| GOV-OS-004 | CLOSED |
| GOV-OS-005 | VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| GOV-OS-006 | CLOSED |

**G-028 C4 vs C6 distinction (preserved):**  
- C4 = `ai.control.*` event-domain contract only  
- C6 = control-plane emitter wiring only  
These are distinct closed units and must not be conflated.

## Session Notes

- Governance OS control plane installed 2026-03-17 by GOV-OS-002
- Canonical operational files: `governance/control/` (5 files — this directory)
- Legacy large files (`gap-register.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-03.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-Q2.md`, `2026-03-audit-reconciliation-matrix.md`) have been archived to `governance/archive/` (GOV-OS-007, 2026-03-17) and replaced with pointer stubs; they are NOT operational truth
- Design documents in `docs/governance/control/` (GOV-OS-001-DESIGN.md + README.md)
- Layer 1 unit records installed: `governance/units/` — 5 canonical unit files + README (GOV-OS-003, SHA 190936f, 2026-03-17)
- Layer 2 decision ledger installed: `governance/decisions/` — 4 files (PRODUCT/DESIGN/SECURITY-DECISIONS.md + README) (GOV-OS-005 VERIFIED_COMPLETE, 2026-03-17)
- Layer 3 execution log installed: `governance/log/` — 2 files (EXECUTION-LOG.md + README) (GOV-OS-006, 2026-03-17)
- BLK-FBW-002-B-001 resolved 2026-03-17: TECS-FBW-002-B-BE-ROUTE-001 (commit 5ffd727) + VERIFY-TECS-FBW-002-B-BE-ROUTE-001 (VERIFIED_COMPLETE). TECS-FBW-002-B transitioned BLOCKED → OPEN.
- TECS-FBW-003-B VERIFIED_COMPLETE 2026-03-18: implementation commit 4d71e17 + VERIFY-TECS-FBW-003-B (PASS). GOV-CLOSE-TECS-FBW-003-B closed unit. Portfolio now at OPERATOR_DECISION_REQUIRED.
- Layer 4 archive installed: `governance/archive/` — README + 4 ARCHIVED-* files (GOV-OS-007, 2026-03-17)
- All 4 Governance OS layers now installed; no product unit is OPEN
- TECS-FBW-002-B frontend implementation complete (commit b647092, 2026-03-17): TradesPanel.tsx + tradeService.ts wired into App.tsx and all 4 shells. tsc EXIT:0.
- VERIFY-TECS-FBW-002-B: VERIFIED_COMPLETE (2026-03-17) — all 9 PASS criteria confirmed; D-017-A posture confirmed.
- GOV-CLOSE-TECS-FBW-002-B-TRADES-PANEL (2026-03-17): TECS-FBW-002-B transitioned OPEN → CLOSED across Layer 0/1/3. NEXT-ACTION.md now OPERATOR_DECISION_REQUIRED.
- Future prompts must read Layer 0 → Layer 1 → Layer 2 before consulting Layer 3; see `governance/log/README.md`
- VOCABULARY SEPARATION (operator directive, 2026-03-17 — three vocabularies, never collapse):
  - Unit status: BLOCKED / DEFERRED / DESIGN_GATE / OPEN / VERIFIED_COMPLETE
  - Decision status: OPEN / DECIDED / SUPERSEDED
  - Log event result: CLOSED / VERIFIED_COMPLETE
  Do not let these collapse into one another in future prompts.
- All product work requires blocker resolution or product/design decision before implementation may proceed
- PRODUCT-DEC-ESCROW-MUTATIONS DECIDED 2026-03-18 (authorized: Paresh). TECS-FBW-003-B promoted DEFERRED → OPEN. See governance/decisions/PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md.
- GOV-RECORD-PRODUCT-DEC-ESCROW-MUTATIONS (2026-03-18): Layer 2 decision recorded; Layers 0/1 updated. NEXT-ACTION.md now points to TECS-FBW-003-B (OPEN).
