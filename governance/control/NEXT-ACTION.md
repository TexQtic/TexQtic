# NEXT-ACTION.md — Layer 0 Governance Pointer

**Authority:** governance/control/TEXQTIC-OPENING-LAYER-GOVERNANCE-AUTHORITY-AND-POINTER-LAYER-2026-04-10.md · **Updated:** 2026-05-01 (TECS-DPP-PASSPORT-NETWORK-017D — VERIFIED_COMPLETE; QA passport PUBLISHED + public buyer URL verified; 27/29 E2E pass; awaiting Paresh authorization for slice 018)
> This file is the governance-facing Layer 0 pointer and live guardrail surface for current
> repo-level posture. Read it after `OPEN-SET.md` and before `BLOCKED.md`. It does not select a
> product-facing opening by itself, and it does not shape the next implementation slice inside a
> chosen family.

  explicit Paresh authorization to open. AI matching, trade workflow AI, market intelligence,
  trust scoring, and RAG benchmark hardening remain deferred.
