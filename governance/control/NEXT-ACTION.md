# NEXT-ACTION.md — Layer 0 Governance Pointer

**Authority:** governance/control/TEXQTIC-OPENING-LAYER-GOVERNANCE-AUTHORITY-AND-POINTER-LAYER-2026-04-10.md · **Updated:** 2026-05-13 (TECS-DPP-PASSPORT-NETWORK-018 — VERIFIED_COMPLETE; JSON-LD machine-readable public DPP structured-data route; 29/31 E2E pass; awaiting Paresh authorization for next slice)
> This file is the governance-facing Layer 0 pointer and live guardrail surface for current
> repo-level posture. Read it after `OPEN-SET.md` and before `BLOCKED.md`. It does not select a
> product-facing opening by itself, and it does not shape the next implementation slice inside a
> chosen family.

  New route: GET /api/public/dpp/:publicPassportId/structured-data.
  Returns JSON-LD (@context, @type: ProductPassport, @id, passportStatus, product, certifications,
  lineageSummary, evidenceSummary, generatedAt). Content-Type: application/ld+json.

  DPP Passport Network productization packet Slices A–G fully implemented and runtime-verified.
  10/10 E2E PASS. 286/286 closure-relevant unit tests PASS. tsc --noEmit CLEAN.
  No active delivery unit. Next unit requires explicit Paresh authorization.
  Next recommended unit: TECS-DPP-PASSPORT-NETWORK-010 — Passport Network Expansion Design Packet
    (evidence vault, trade linkage, real AI assistant architecture, COMPLIANCE/GLOBAL_DPP tiers).
  Do NOT open next unit without Paresh authorization.
  Full platform launch NOT AUTHORIZED.

  Read order: OPEN-SET.md -> NEXT-ACTION.md -> BLOCKED.md -> SNAPSHOT.md.
  This file is the sole current Layer 0 guardrail pointer.
  No price field anywhere in Phase 1 or Phase 2 scope.
  Per-item publicationPosture filtering deferred to Phase 3+.
  Phase 3+ deferred: price disclosure, buyer-supplier allowlist (Phase 6).
  TECS-DPP-PASSPORT-FOUNDATION-001 DESIGN_ACTIVE (2026-04-28). Design artifact created.
  All implementation slices (D-1 through D-6) UNAUTHORIZED until Paresh opens each.
  TECS-B2B-BUYER-CATALOG-PDP-001 VERIFIED_COMPLETE (2026-04-27).
  All 4 slices delivered and verified: P-1 d8fec78, P-2 d8d6141, P-3 f871bcb, P-4 54fecbc.
  Verification: 239/239 catalog tests PASS. TypeScript clean.
  Prior closed: TECS-AI-DOCUMENT-INTELLIGENCE-MVP-001 VERIFIED_COMPLETE (2026-04-27).
  TECS-AI-FOUNDATION-DATA-CONTRACTS-001 is IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.
  AI data contracts and boundaries defined — remaining future AI implementation units require
  explicit Paresh authorization to open. AI matching, trade workflow AI, market intelligence,
  trust scoring, and RAG benchmark hardening remain deferred.
