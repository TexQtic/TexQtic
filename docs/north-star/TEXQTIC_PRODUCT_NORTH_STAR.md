# TEXQTIC — PRODUCT NORTH STAR V2
## (Balanced Authority Model)

**Status:** 🔒 Locked & Economically Aligned

**Purpose:** Define TexQtic as compliance-governed infrastructure that enables capital flow without becoming a financial intermediary.

---

## 1️⃣ Core Definition

TexQtic is a **compliance-first, trade-chain-native operating system** for regulated textile trade.

**Dominant Axis: Regulatory Defensibility.**

TexQtic enforces compliance state across the supply chain:

**Yarn → Fabric → Processing → Garment → Buyer.**

**Trade can proceed only when compliance gates are satisfied.**

---

## 2️⃣ Governed Liquidity Doctrine

TexQtic enables liquidity **only when compliance state permits it**.

Liquidity is:

- **Triggered** by verified compliance
- **Executed** by licensed financial partners
- **Conditioned** by risk intelligence
- **Structured** outside TexQtic's custody

**TexQtic does not:**

- Hold funds
- Lend capital
- Underwrite credit
- Guarantee transactions

**TexQtic provides:**

- Compliance validation
- Risk scoring
- Settlement trigger authorization
- Event immutability

**Capital follows compliance.**

---

## 3️⃣ Strategic Moat

TexQtic creates a **Network of Necessity** by:

- Making compliance non-bypassable
- Becoming required for DPP validation
- Conditioning financial flows on verified state
- Owning cross-system regulatory orchestration

**Liquidity strengthens governance.**
**Governance controls liquidity.**

## 4️⃣ Growth Logic

We do not optimize for volume.

**We optimize for:**

- Regulatory pressure
- Risk exposure
- Financial certainty

**Growth follows compliance enforcement.**

---

## 5️⃣ Risk Containment

Financial execution handled by:

- Licensed PSPs
- Regulated escrow custodians
- Bank financing partners

**TexQtic remains infrastructure.**

**That keeps doctrine intact.**

Liquidity increases moat.
