## 1. Reconciliation Method

For every finding from both reports the following classification rules apply:

| Label | Rule |
|---|---|
| `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` | Both reports identify the same issue with consistent characterisation |
| `NEW_IN_CODEX` | Only Codex identified the issue; Copilot omitted or did not inspect the surface |
| `NEW_IN_COPILOT` | Only Copilot identified the issue; Codex omitted or did not inspect the surface |
| `CROSS_REPORT_CONFLICT` | Reports assign materially different verdicts to the same surface |
| `DEFERRED_BY_DOCTRINE` | Both reports agree the surface is an intentional phase boundary or product decision |

Merged statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `VALIDATED` | Corroborated by both reports; ready for implementation wave assignment |
| `PROVISIONAL` | Single-report only; no contradiction; acceptable for wave assignment pending verification |
| `VERIFY_REQUIRED` | Conflict between reports, or insufficient evidence to safely classify; must be verified before implementation |
| `DEFERRED` | Intentional product boundary; no implementation until phase gate opens |
| `REQUIRES_BACKEND_DESIGN` | Cannot wire frontend-first; backend route/product design prerequisite |

## 2. Evidence-Backed Reconciliation Worksheet

Evidence references are quoted from the source document using section + short anchor.

### 2A. Corroborated Findings (Both Reports)

**TECS-FBW-001 — Finance/Compliance/Dispute Authority Mutations**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §5.1 "Control-plane finance/compliance/dispute actions" | §4 F-009 "Finance / Compliance / Dispute Authority Mutations" |
| Key anchor | "backend also exposes approve/reject/resolve/escalate POST routes requiring idempotency headers → no frontend trigger" | "no approve/reject button. No service function" — all 3 panels confirmed |
| Finding type | frontend pending / backend complete | BACKEND_COMPLETE / FRONTEND_ABSENT |
| Overlap status | Same issue — identical characterisation |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | ~~`VALIDATED`~~ → **`IMPLEMENTED — FULLY CLOSED`** · Compliance: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-107 · Finance: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-108 · Disputes: GOVERNANCE-SYNC-109 (2026-03-07) |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-002 — G-017 Trades Frontend Absent**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §5.2 "advanced operational flows (trades…)" | §4 F-001 "G-017 Trades — Backend Complete, Zero Frontend" |
| Key anchor | "Route plugins are registered and implemented; no frontend consumers found" for trades.g017.ts | "controlPlaneService.ts (494 lines, read in full) contains zero trade functions" |
| Overlap status | Same issue |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED` — TECS-FBW-002-A: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-110 · 2026-03-07 · control-plane TradeOversight read surface); TECS-FBW-002-B: 🚫 BLOCKED (no GET /api/tenant/trades tenant-plane route) |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-003 — G-018 Escrow Frontend Absent**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §5.2 | §4 F-002 "G-018 Escrow — Backend Complete, Zero Frontend" |
| Key anchor | "escrow.g018.ts … no frontend consumers" | "7 endpoints confirmed … Zero functions in services. Zero components" |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `TECS-FBW-003-A: CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-111 · 2026-03-07); TECS-FBW-003-B: FUTURE SCOPE (mutations + detail view)` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-004 — G-019 Settlements Frontend Absent**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §5.2 | §4 F-003 "G-019 Settlements — Backend Complete, Zero Frontend" |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-113 · 2026-03-07)` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-005 — G-019 Certifications Frontend Absent**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §5.2 | §4 F-004 "G-019 Certifications — Backend Complete, Zero Frontend" |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-114 · 2026-03-07) — tenant LIST/CREATE/DETAIL/TRANSITION panel + ControlPlane admin read surface; D-017-A + D-020-C + D-020-D + D-022-C satisfied; 8 files (3 NEW + 5 SUNE); typecheck EXIT 0; lint EXIT 0 |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-006 — G-022 Escalations Frontend Absent [control-plane misrouting claim disproved]**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §5.2 "escalations/traceability" | §4 F-006 "G-022 Escalation — Backend Complete, Zero Tenant Frontend; Control Plane Wired to Wrong Endpoint" |
| Key anchor | "no frontend consumers found" | "DisputeCases.tsx is wired to getDisputes() → GET /api/control/disputes … not /api/control/escalations" |
| Overlap notes | Copilot adds specific misrouting detail (disputes≠escalations) not explicitly stated by Codex; substance is the same gap. **CORRECTION (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-112, 2026-03-07): The "misrouting" claim was disproved during pre-implementation verification. DisputeCases.tsx correctly calls GET /api/control/disputes (event-log domain); disputes and escalation_events are structurally separate entities. DisputeCases.tsx was not misrouted and remained untouched throughout TECS-FBW-006-A.** |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `TECS-FBW-006-A: ✅ CLOSED (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-112 · 2026-03-07); TECS-FBW-006-B: 🔵 FUTURE SCOPE (mutations: upgrade/resolve/override)` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

**TECS-FBW-007 — Cart Summaries Dead Service Code**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §5.3 | §6 F-007 "Cart Summaries — Service Functions Exist, No UI Consumer" |
| Key anchor | "no component imports those methods" | "No AdminView state maps to a cart summaries panel. The functions are dead service code" |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `VALIDATED` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-008 — WhiteLabelSettings Custom Domain Dead in EXPERIENCE Shell**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §6.3 "White-label settings custom domain card" | §6 F-013 "WhiteLabelSettings 'Custom Domain' — Dead UI in EXPERIENCE Shell" |
| Key anchor | "Domain input/Connect button are non-wired in settings view" | "no onClick handler and calls no API" |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `VALIDATED` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-012 — TeamManagement Edit Access Dead Button**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §6.2 "Team Management access editing" | §6 F-014 "TeamManagement 'Edit Access' — Dead Button, No Backend Route" |
| Key anchor | "Edit Access button has no handler and no corresponding update route" | "no onClick. No role-change API exists (PATCH /api/tenant/memberships/:id is absent)" |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `VALIDATED` |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Note | Also confirmed by Q2 tracker Section 12.3: "Membership edit (role update) ❌ Not implemented" |

---

**TECS-FBW-015 — G-016 Traceability CRUD Frontend Absent**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §5.2 "traceability" row | §4 F-005 "G-016 Traceability CRUD — Backend Complete, Only Snapshot Consumed" |
| Key anchor | "no frontend consumers found" | "Zero traceability CRUD functions in services. Zero components for node/edge creation" |
| Additional note | Copilot notes DPPPassport consumes DPP snapshot (GET /api/tenant/dpp/:nodeId) — a different endpoint, not the CRUD surface | Codex and Copilot agree on the gap |
| Merged classification | `RECONFIRMED_BY_CODEX_AND_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `VALIDATED` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-STUB-001 — Intentional Placeholder Surfaces (WL/Admin Architecture/Skeleton)**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §9.1 "WL admin/product surfaces and control-plane architecture pages" | §9 S-001 through S-005 |
| Key anchor | "explicitly placeholder/skeleton content with non-functional buttons" | "intentional product phase boundaries rather than implementation oversights" |
| Merged classification | `DEFERRED_BY_DOCTRINE` |
| Merged status | `DEFERRED` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

### 2B. Copilot-Only Findings (New in Copilot — No Contradiction)

**TECS-FBW-011 — Catalog basePrice vs price — CRITICAL Runtime Bug**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §4 F-012 / §7 CM-001 | Not identified |
| Key anchor | "CatalogItem interface uses basePrice but backend returns price. Every catalog item renders as $undefined.00." | Codex identified catalog as "⚠️ Contract mismatch" in Section 3 table but characterised it as a field name issue without specifying basePrice/price; did not elevate to CRITICAL |
| Reasoning | The Copilot finding is specific, has direct code evidence (interface declaration + render sites), and is not contradicted by Codex. Codex Table §3 lists "Catalog READ → ⚠️ Contract mismatch" which is consistent but less specific. Treating as NEW_IN_COPILOT given the specificity gap. |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `VALIDATED` (no contradiction; code evidence is explicit) |
| Confidence | HIGH — CRITICAL PRIORITY |

---

**TECS-FBW-013 — B2B Request Quote Dead Button**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §6 F-015 | §10 "uncertain findings" — uncertain, not confirmed gap |
| Key anchor | "No onClick, no service call, no backend quote/inquiry endpoint" | "Could be intentional product gating" |
| Reasoning | Copilot confirmed no onClick. Codex flagged as uncertain. No contradiction — Copilot provides more specific evidence. |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `DEFERRED` (product gating intent; Copilot Section 9 S-003 classifies as "Product Boundary Under Review") |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |

---

**TECS-FBW-014 — Post-Checkout No Order Confirmation State**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §6 F-016 | Not identified |
| Key anchor | "checkout() → POST /api/tenant/checkout returns {orderId, message}. After the call succeeds, the application closes the cart … orderId is discarded." | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `PROVISIONAL` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-016 — Tenant Audit Logs Backend Present, No Tenant UI**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §3 table row "Tenant audit logs" | Not distinctly identified |
| Key anchor | "GET /api/tenant/audit-logs → ❌ Missing → ❌ Missing → ❌ Gap" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `PROVISIONAL` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-017 — CatalogItem.category Grouping May Fail**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §7 CM-002 | Not identified |
| Key anchor | "CatalogItem.category field is typed as category?: string (optional)" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `✅ CLOSED — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-105 · 2026-03-07` |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Resolution | Governance-only closeout. Copilot-projected risk already satisfied by WLCollectionsPanel.tsx shipped in GOVERNANCE-SYNC-066: (item.category ?? ‘’).trim() \|\| UNCATEGORISED. No code change made. |

---

**TECS-FBW-018 — Plan BASIC→TRIAL Enum Misalignment**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §7 CM-003 | Not identified |
| Key anchor | "backend returns plan: 'BASIC'; frontend type uses 'TRIAL'" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `PROVISIONAL` |
| Confidence | HIGH — but intentional mapping noted via code comment |

---

**TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE — AI Governance Dead Authority Actions**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §4 F-011, §9 S-004 | Not distinctly identified |
| Key anchor | "No PUT /api/control/ai-budget/:tenantId … dead action buttons align with G-028" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `REQUIRES_BACKEND_DESIGN` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-ADMINRBAC — AdminRBAC No Backend Route**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §4 F-010, §9 S-001 | Not distinctly identified |
| Key anchor | "No route for /api/control/admin-users … renders from ADMIN_USERS — a compile-time constant" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `REQUIRES_BACKEND_DESIGN` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-MOQ — MOQ_NOT_MET 422 Missing UX**

| Attribute | Copilot Evidence | Codex Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §11 P4.4 | Not identified |
| Key anchor | "POST /api/tenant/cart/items returns 422 MOQ_NOT_MET. Add a user-facing error toast" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_COPILOT` |
| Merged status | `✅ CLOSED — GOVERNANCE-SYNC-103 · 2026-03-07` |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Resolution | B2CAddToCartButton (App.tsx): addError state; inline rose-600 error text; typecheck+lint EXIT 0 |

---

### 2C. Codex-Only Findings (New in Codex — Not Contradicted)

**TECS-FBW-020 — WL Admin Invite Path Shell Routing**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §6.1 "WL admin staff invite flow" | Not identified distinctly |
| Key anchor | "WL admin STAFF → TeamManagement.onInvite → setAppState('INVITE_MEMBER') → INVITE_MEMBER renders via EXPERIENCE shell branch" | Not inspected |
| Reasoning | Q2 tracker Section 12.4 confirms invite wiring was fixed in P-5/P-6, but that fix was in TeamManagement.tsx → InviteMemberForm.tsx. The shell routing for WL_ADMIN context specifically was not confirmed as fixed. Requires targeted verification. |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_CODEX` |
| Merged status | `VERIFY_REQUIRED` |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |

---

**TECS-FBW-OA-001 — OpenAPI Tenant Contract Drift**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §7.1 "Tenant API contract coverage" | Not inspected (Copilot noted CM-003/004 field mismatches but did not audit OpenAPI files) |
| Key anchor | "openapi.tenant.json does not include multiple actively used tenant endpoints" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_CODEX` |
| Merged status | `VERIFY_REQUIRED` |
| Confidence | HIGH (OpenAPI files were directly inspected by Codex) |

---

**TECS-FBW-OA-002 — OpenAPI Control-Plane Contract Drift**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §7.2 "Control-plane API contract coverage" | Not inspected |
| Key anchor | "openapi.control-plane.json omits active GET endpoints (/finance/payouts, /compliance/requests, /disputes, /system/health, /whoami) and impersonation routes" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_CODEX` |
| Merged status | `VERIFY_REQUIRED` |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-AT-006 — Order Status Transition Role Gating**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §8.1 "Tenant order transitions in EXPERIENCE shell" | AT-001 confirmed realm enforcement correct — but this is a different surface (UI role-gating before PATCH attempt) |
| Key anchor | "UI exposes status transition actions broadly; backend enforces OWNER/ADMIN gate" | Not specifically flagged; Copilot confirmed order status PATCH is "✅ Wired" (Section 3 table) |
| Reasoning | Not a conflict — Copilot confirmed wiring exists; Codex identified the UX gap where non-admin tenants see actions they will be 403'd on. Two separate concerns. |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_CODEX` |
| Merged status | `VERIFY_REQUIRED` |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |

---

**TECS-FBW-AUTH-001 — Tenant Login Hardcoded Seeded Tenant Picker**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §9.2 "Tenant login tenant selection" | Not identified |
| Key anchor | "auth form → seeded tenant IDs → login call; TODO references non-existent /api/public/tenants/resolve" | Not inspected |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_CODEX` |
| Merged status | ~~`VERIFY_REQUIRED`~~ → **`IMPLEMENTED — FULLY CLOSED`** · VER-006: FAIL (2026-03-13) · implementation: commit 476b3d3 · GOVERNANCE-SYNC-TECS-FBW-AUTH-001 |
| Confidence | HIGH |

---

**TECS-FBW-RLS-001 — RLS-Only Posture / App-Layer org_id Governance**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Position |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §8.2 "Tenant scoping posture in route implementations" | AT-003 confirms org_id RLS correctly applied for escrow; AT-002 confirms tenantId from JWT — different angle |
| Key anchor | "Multiple tenant routes explicitly removed manual tenant filters and rely on RLS-only for boundary enforcement" | Q2 tracker Section 12.2: "GET /api/tenant/memberships does not apply a manual where: { tenantId } filter. RLS policies on the memberships table enforce tenant isolation via app.org_id. Defense in depth remains intact." |
| Reasoning | This is a governance posture question, not an implementation defect. The Q2 tracker documents the intentional decision for memberships. Codex raises the same question at the platform level. No conflict — governance clarification needed system-wide. |
| Merged classification | `NEW_IN_CODEX` |
| Merged status | `VERIFY_REQUIRED` |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |

---

### 2D. Cross-Report Conflicts

**TECS-FBW-PROV-001 — Tenant Provisioning Contract Alignment**

| Attribute | Codex Evidence | Copilot Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source section | §4.1 "Control-plane tenant provisioning" | §3 table row "Tenant provision" |
| Codex verdict | "contract mismatch — request validation will fail; frontend success parsing incompatible" — fields: {name,slug,type,ownerEmail,ownerPassword} vs backend {orgName,primaryAdminEmail,primaryAdminPassword} | "✅ Wired" — provisionTenant() listed as wired in feature area table |
| Conflict type | Codex inspected the field-level contract and found a mismatch. Copilot inspected the service wiring path (call exists) and marked it wired. Both can be simultaneously true: a call path exists but transmits wrong fields. |
| Merged classification | ~~`CROSS_REPORT_CONFLICT`~~ → **RESOLVED (VER-001 · 2026-03-06)** |
| Merged status | ~~`VERIFY_REQUIRED`~~ → **`VALIDATED`** |
| Confidence | HIGH — confirmed by direct file inspection |
| Resolution | VER-001 executed 2026-03-06 (read-only). **Codex §4.1 confirmed correct.** Copilot §3 "✅ Wired" classification superseded — call path exists but all 5 request fields are wrong and the response shape is incompatible. Deterministic HTTP 400 on every invocation. TECS-FBW-PROV-001 promoted to Wave 1 implementation. |

## 5. Conflicts Explicitly Preserved

### TECS-FBW-PROV-001 (CROSS_REPORT_CONFLICT — RESOLVED 2026-03-06)

**Codex:** "frontend provisioning request/response contract does not match the active backend route contract" — field names differ: `{name,slug,type,ownerEmail,ownerPassword}` vs `{orgName,primaryAdminEmail,primaryAdminPassword}`  
**Copilot:** `TenantRegistry` → `provisionTenant()` listed as "✅ Wired" in §3 feature table without field-level inspection  
**Resolution (VER-001 · 2026-03-06):** Codex confirmed correct. Direct inspection of `services/controlPlaneService.ts` `ProvisionTenantRequest` vs `admin/tenantProvision.ts` `provisionBodySchema` — all 5 request fields mismatched; response shape also incompatible (backend flat `{orgId,slug,userId,membershipId}` vs frontend nested `{tenant,owner}`). Runtime: HTTP 400 on every call. Copilot "Wired" classification superseded — call path exists but contract has never been correct. Historical conflict record preserved above for traceability.  
**Promotion:** TECS-FBW-PROV-001 → VALIDATED · Wave 1 implementation unit (services/controlPlaneService.ts).

## 9. Pre-Wave-5 Remediation Registration (2026-03-08)

**Registered:** 2026-03-08 — following completion of two independent repo-truth audits  
**Authority:** Paresh  
**Trigger:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-118 + Full TexQtic Platform Map audit + Navigation verification audit  
**Program container:** `PRE-WAVE-5-REMEDIATION-001 — Platform Wiring and Runtime Truth Reconciliation`

### Source Audits

Two audits completed 2026-03-08 triggered this registration:

1. **Full TexQtic Platform Map audit** — enumerated all platform domains by layer (DB model / API route / UI surface); classified each as wired, partially-wired, stub, or absent
2. **Navigation verification audit** — walked every nav item in both shells and every route registered in App.tsx; recorded dead nav items, stub panels, backend-exists/UI-missing gaps, and placeholder control-plane panels

Both audits were repo-inspection only (not runtime). No application code was modified during either audit.

### Finding Type Classification

| Finding Type | Classification | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Agreed findings (both audits consistent in wired status) | `AGREED` | Implementation-ready; may be assigned to wiring tranche sub-units |
| Conflicting findings (audits differ on wire status) | `VERIFY_REQUIRED` | Must resolve by targeted repo inspection before implementation |
| Dead visible UI with no backend route or wiring path | `DEAD_UI` | Must be hidden/gated before further expansion; UX correctness tranche |
| Backend route exists but UI surface absent | `BACKEND_EXISTS_UI_MISSING` | Higher priority than net-new domains |
| Placeholder control-plane panels (static docs/spec/roadmap views) | `PLACEHOLDER_PANEL` | Do not count as wired surfaces; must not anchor Wave 5 planning |

### Program Registration Outcome

**Program `PRE-WAVE-5-REMEDIATION-001`** is registered in:

- `governance/gap-register.md` → `PRE-WAVE-5-REMEDIATION-001` section
- `docs/governance/IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-03.md` → Pre-Wave-5 Remediation Program section
- `docs/governance/MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2026-03.md` → Section 10

**14 ordered sub-units** registered across 5 tranches:

- **Verification (V):** PW5-V1 (DPP), PW5-V2 (Tenant Audit Logs), PW5-V3 (TenantType), PW5-V4 (Shell actions)
- **UX Correctness (U):** PW5-U1 (B2C cart badge), PW5-U2 (dead tenant nav), PW5-U3 (dead CP actions), PW5-U4 (static CP panels)
- **Wiring (W):** PW5-W1 (Tenant Trades — BACKEND DESIGN GATE), PW5-W2 (Escrow), PW5-W3 (Settlement), PW5-W4 (Maker-Checker)
- **White-Label (WL):** PW5-WL1, PW5-WL2, PW5-WL3, PW5-WL4
- **Planning (CP/AI):** PW5-CP-PLAN, PW5-AI-PLAN

### Critical Flags from This Audit Registration

> **PW5-V1 (DPP):** Wired in GOVERNANCE-SYNC-083. Typecheck/lint EXIT 0 recorded. No runtime call trace in governance. Mark as VERIFY FIRST — do not claim implementation-complete without live API call evidence.

> **PW5-V2 (Tenant Audit Logs):** ✅ VERIFIED + PW5-FIX-V2A CLOSED — 2026-03-08. Backend runtime-proven (HTTP 401 unauth + HTTP 200 auth). Frontend path mismatch found and fixed: TenantAuditLogs.tsx '/tenant/audit-logs' → '/api/tenant/audit-logs' (PW5-FIX-V2A). Post-fix runtime: HTTP 200 { logs:[], count:0 }. TSC_EXIT:0. Classification: WORKING. Audit conflict ("route/path mismatch concern") resolved — backend route was always correct; defect was frontend prefix omission only.

> **PW5-W1 (Tenant Trades UI):** `TECS-FBW-002-B` remains 🚫 BLOCKED. `GET /api/tenant/trades` does not exist as a tenant-plane route. This is a BACKEND DESIGN GATE — no UI wiring is possible until the route is designed and implemented.

### Wave 5 Block Conditions (Recorded at Registration)

Wave 5 architecture sequencing does not begin until:

- [ ] Verification tranche (PW5-V1 through PW5-V4) fully resolved with evidence
- [ ] Dead UI gating (PW5-U2 and PW5-U3 minimum) complete
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER Pre-Wave-5 ordered sequence updated to reflect completions

These conditions are non-waivable. Recorded in MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN §10.5.

### PW5-V1 TECS Unit B1 — DPP Verification Closure Evidence (2026-03-09)

**Unit:** TECS Unit B1 — DPP Runtime Verification  
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Verdict:** PASS  
**Method:** Read-only static inspection — full call chain traced from UI entry point to DB snapshot views

**Static path confirmation:**
- UI entry: `DPPPassport` component navigable from all 4 tenant shells (AggregatorShell L40, B2BShell L63, B2CShell L109, WhiteLabelShell L145); `App.tsx` L562: `if (expView === 'DPP') return <DPPPassport onBack={() => setExpView('HOME')} />;`
- API call: `tenantGet<DppSnapshot>(\`/api/tenant/dpp/${encodeURIComponent(trimmed)}\`)` — TENANT realm guard + `X-Texqtic-Realm: tenant` header enforced via `services/tenantApiClient.ts`
- Backend route: `fastify.get('/tenant/dpp/:nodeId', { onRequest: [tenantAuthMiddleware, databaseContextMiddleware] }, ...)` — confirmed in `server/src/routes/tenant.ts`

**DB snapshot views (all 3 confirmed in migrations):**
- `dpp_snapshot_products_v1` — `SECURITY INVOKER`; manufacturer fields restored (migration `20260316000003_g025_dpp_views_manufacturer_restore`)
- `dpp_snapshot_lineage_v1` — `SECURITY INVOKER`; recursive CTE depth cap 20 (migration `20260316000001_g025_dpp_snapshot_views`)
- `dpp_snapshot_certifications_v1` — `SECURITY INVOKER` (migration `20260316000001_g025_dpp_snapshot_views`)

**Tenant isolation:** `withDbContext(prisma, dbContext)` sets `app.org_id`; all 3 views `SECURITY INVOKER`; `FORCE RLS` fires; 404 fail-closed guard on empty product rows.  
**Payload match:** All fields confirmed between backend response shape and frontend `DppSnapshot` interface.  
**Git diff:** No files modified during verification — read-only inspection confirmed.

**Defect registered: PW5-V1-DEF-001**
- Type: Governance Contract Drift
- Description: `GET /api/tenant/dpp/:nodeId` absent from `shared/contracts/openapi.tenant.json`
- Impact: Documentation only — runtime not affected
- Action: Future contract-sync TECS unit

**Reclassification:** DPP / Passport = **VERIFIED** — TECS Unit B1 PASS closes the outstanding `⏳ VERIFY FIRST` flag from audit registration. Implementation confirmed complete and runtime-consistent.

### PW5-V3 TECS Unit B2 — TenantType Enum Verification FAIL Evidence (2026-03-09)

**Unit:** TECS Unit B2 — TenantType Enum Verification  
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Verdict:** FAIL  
**Method:** Read-only multi-layer static inspection — Prisma schema, DB migration, backend type alias, API routes, frontend enum, OpenAPI spec. No files modified.

**Enum comparison matrix:**

| Layer | File | Values |
|---|---|---|
| DB type (enforced) | Init migration SQL | `B2B`, `B2C`, `INTERNAL` |
| Prisma schema | `server/prisma/schema.prisma` | `B2B`, `B2C`, `INTERNAL` |
| Backend type alias | `server/src/types/index.ts` | `'B2B' \| 'B2C' \| 'INTERNAL'` |
| Runtime expectation | `server/src/routes/auth.ts` comment | `'B2B' \| 'WHITE_LABEL' \| 'AGGREGATOR' \| 'B2C'` |
| Frontend enum | `types.ts` | `AGGREGATOR`, `B2B`, `B2C`, `WHITE_LABEL` |

**Key findings:**
- `AGGREGATOR` and `WHITE_LABEL` are required by frontend shell routing but cannot be produced by any current Prisma code path or active provision route
- `INTERNAL` exists in DB/Prisma/backend but has no frontend shell — silently falls back to `AggregatorShell`
- Active provision route (`POST /api/control/tenants/provision`) accepts no `type` field — all tenants provisioned as `B2B` (default)
- `sync_tenants_to_organizations()` trigger copies `tenants.type::text` → `organizations.org_type`; only {B2B, B2C, INTERNAL} can flow through this path
- OpenAPI specs do not define a `TenantType` schema component in either spec file
- No mapping layer exists — API emits raw `org_type` string pass-through; frontend applies silent fallback guard only

**Defects registered:** PW5-V3-DEF-001 (INTERNAL no frontend shell — Medium), PW5-V3-DEF-002 (AGGREGATOR/WHITE_LABEL schema gap — High), PW5-V3-DEF-003 (backend alias stale — Low). Full defect entries in `governance/gap-register.md`.

**Git diff:** No files modified during inspection — `git diff --name-only` was empty during TECS Unit B2 session.

**Next action:** B2-DESIGN unit — product decision required before any migration or code change.

---

## 8. No-Change Confirmation

This document was produced by read-only analysis of two audit reports and existing governance documents.  
No application code was modified.  
No OpenAPI spec files were changed.  
No Prisma schema or migration files were touched.  
No backend routes were added or modified.

## 9. B2-DESIGN — Canonical TenantType Decision Evidence (2026-03-09)

**Unit:** B2-DESIGN (design-only) + B2-DESIGN-GOV (governance documentation)  
**Date:** 2026-03-09  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — APPROVED FOR REMEDIATION SEQUENCING  
**Verdict:** Architecture locked. Remediation path (B2-REM-1..5) approved. PW5-V3 defects remain OPEN until implementation complete.

### 9.1 Root Cause Summary

PW5-V3 FAIL was caused by a single `org_type` free-text String field carrying three distinct semantic responsibilities across the TexQtic platform:

| Responsibility | Current carrier | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| Organizational identity | `org_type` String (free-text) | No DB enum constraint; any string accepted |
| Deployment/capability mode | `org_type` String (value `WHITE_LABEL`) | White Label mixed with identity values |
| Experience shell routing signal | `TenantType` frontend enum (raw pass-through) | Silent `default:` fallback when unknown value received |

This caused enum divergence across five layers: DB (`tenant_type` PG enum), Prisma schema, backend type alias, auth serialization comment, and frontend enum.

### 9.2 Final Canonical Model

**Axis 1 — Canonical Organizational Identity**

```
tenant_category: AGGREGATOR | B2B | B2C | INTERNAL
```

- `AGGREGATOR` — first-class platform aggregator organization
- `B2B` — business-to-business operating tenant
- `B2C` — business-to-consumer operating tenant
- `INTERNAL` — internal/operator/system organization category
- `WHITE_LABEL` — **permanently removed from identity axis**

**Axis 2 — Deployment/Capability Mode**

```
is_white_label: BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false
```

- White Label is a deployment/capability flag, not an organizational identity type.
- Chosen over `deployment_mode ENUM` for long-term extensibility (avoids repeating the overload problem).
- Future modes (EMBEDDED, HEADLESS) can be added as independent boolean flags.

**Axis 3 — Experience Shell Resolution**

```
resolveExperienceShell(tenant_category, is_white_label) → Shell
```

- Derived from axes 1 and 2 via an explicit policy function.
- No raw `org_type` pass-through permitted.
- Silent `default:` enum fallback FORBIDDEN.
- Unknown `tenant_category` input → error state + amber banner; never silent routing.

### 9.3 Approved Shell Resolution Matrix

| `tenant_category` | `is_white_label` | Resolved shell | Policy note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AGGREGATOR` | `false` | `AggregatorShell` | First-class aggregator identity |
| `AGGREGATOR` | `true` | `AggregatorShell` | WL flag on aggregator; no distinct shell Phase 1 |
| `B2B` | `false` | `B2BShell` | Standard B2B experience |
| `B2B` | `true` | `WhiteLabelShell` | WL B2B; OWNER/ADMIN → WL Admin console |
| `B2C` | `false` | `B2CShell` | Standard B2C storefront |
| `B2C` | `true` | `WhiteLabelShell` | WL B2C; OWNER/ADMIN → WL Admin console |
| `INTERNAL` | `false` | `AggregatorShell` | **Explicit named policy rule** — not default fallback |
| `INTERNAL` | `true` | `AggregatorShell` | Same as INTERNAL/false in Phase 1 |
| `null` / unknown | any | Error state + amber banner | Never silently falls through |

### 9.4 Remediation Sequence

| Unit | Scope |
|---|---|
| B2-REM-1 | Schema / enum / migration — add `AGGREGATOR` to Prisma `TenantType` enum; add `is_white_label BOOLEAN` to `tenants` and `organizations`; data migration to remap `WHITE_LABEL` `org_type` rows |
| B2-REM-2 | Backend serialization / auth alignment — emit `tenant_category` + `is_white_label` in login response; deprecate freeform `org_type` pass-through |
| B2-REM-3 | Frontend enum / routing alignment — add `INTERNAL` to frontend `TenantType`; implement `resolveExperienceShell()` policy function; remove silent `default:` fallback |
| B2-REM-4 | OpenAPI / contract synchronization — update `openapi.tenant.json` + `openapi.control-plane.json` to reflect canonical model |
| B2-REM-5 | Provisioning flow update — `tenant_category` + `is_white_label` in provisioning request body and `TenantRegistry.tsx` UI |

### 9.5 Design Verdict

**APPROVED FOR REMEDIATION SEQUENCING**

All design questions answered. No implementation occurred in B2-DESIGN or B2-DESIGN-GOV. The canonical model is locked. The remediation sequence is governance-valid. B2-REM-1 may be sequenced next.

### 9.6 B2-REM-1 Closure Addendum (2026-03-09)

**B2-REM-1 — ✅ CLOSED as of 2026-03-09**  
**Commit:** d893524  
**Scope:** Schema / enum / migration layer only.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Schema changes applied | `AGGREGATOR` added to `TenantType` Prisma enum; `is_white_label BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` added to `tenants` and `organizations` tables |
| Data migration | Legacy `WHITE_LABEL` `org_type` organization rows remapped to `B2B` + `is_white_label=true` |
| Validation gates | Gates 1–5 PASS |
| Atomicity | One atomic commit (d893524) |
| org_id / RLS posture | Unchanged — no RLS policy or tenant isolation logic modified |
| g026 / g028 treatment | Syntax-only fixes applied as user-approved prerequisites to unblock `prisma migrate deploy`; zero functional change; incidental to migration apply; not part of B2-REM-1 design scope proper; do not create a new gap row |

**PW5-V3-DEF-002 — Partially Remediated at Schema Layer Only**  
The schema layer deficit (AGGREGATOR and WHITE_LABEL unreachable via Prisma enum) is now resolved. Full defect closure is **not yet achieved**. Remaining layers still open:

| Layer | Unit | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Backend serialization / auth alignment | B2-REM-2 | ⏳ Pending |
| Frontend enum / routing alignment | B2-REM-3 | ⏳ Pending |
| OpenAPI / contract synchronization | B2-REM-4 | ⏳ Pending |
| Provisioning flow update | B2-REM-5 | ⏳ Pending |

**PW5-V3 — ❌ FAIL Overall**  
PW5-V3 remains ❌ FAIL overall. B2-REM-1 closes the schema layer only. B2-REM-2 through B2-REM-5 must be completed before PW5-V3 can be transitioned to PASS. This addendum records schema-layer progress only — it does not constitute full defect closure and must not be read as resolving the tranche.

---

### 9.7 B2-REM-2 Closure Addendum (2026-03-10)

**B2-REM-2 — ✅ CLOSED as of 2026-03-10**  
**Commit:** efbce82  
**Scope:** Backend serialization / auth alignment layer only.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Files changed | `server/src/lib/database-context.ts`; `server/src/routes/auth.ts`; `server/src/routes/tenant.ts` |
| `database-context.ts` | `OrganizationIdentity` interface: `is_white_label: boolean` added; Prisma select clause: `is_white_label: true` added |
| `auth.ts` — unified login | `isWhiteLabel` variable added; `tenant_category` + `is_white_label` included in `sendSuccess` response |
| `auth.ts` — dedicated tenant login | Fail-open `getOrganizationIdentity()` block added; `tenant_category` + `is_white_label` included in `sendSuccess` response |
| `tenant.ts` — GET /api/me | `tenant_category: string; is_white_label: boolean` added to inline type; `tenant_category: org.org_type` and `is_white_label: org.is_white_label` added to tenant object literal |
| JWT payload | Unchanged — `{userId, tenantId, role}` — identity fields resolved at runtime via `getOrganizationIdentity()` |
| Compat preservation | Legacy `tenantType` and `tenant.type` fields retained in all three serialization points |
| Validation | typecheck 0 errors; `GET /health` HTTP 200; 7/7 integration tests PASS (315s) |
| org_id / RLS posture | Unchanged — no RLS policy or tenant isolation logic modified |
| Atomicity | One atomic commit (efbce82) |

**PW5-V3-DEF-003 — ✅ CLOSED**  
Backend alias stale defect resolved. `tenant_category` + `is_white_label` are now emitted at all three auth serialization points. The freeform `org_type` pass-through is superseded by canonical fields.

**PW5-V3-DEF-002 — Partially Remediated at Schema + Backend Layers**  
Schema layer (B2-REM-1) and backend serialization layer (B2-REM-2) are now complete. Full defect closure is **not yet achieved**. Remaining layers still open:

| Layer | Unit | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend enum / routing alignment | B2-REM-3 | ⏳ Pending |
| OpenAPI / contract synchronization | B2-REM-4 | ⏳ Pending |
| Provisioning flow update | B2-REM-5 | ⏳ Pending |

**PW5-V3-DEF-001 — NO CHANGE — OPEN**  
`INTERNAL` tenant category still has no frontend shell. No change from B2-REM-2. B2-REM-3 is the responsible unit.

**PW5-V3 — ❌ FAIL Overall**  
PW5-V3 remains ❌ FAIL overall. B2-REM-2 closes the backend serialization layer only. B2-REM-3 through B2-REM-5 must be completed before PW5-V3 can be transitioned to PASS. This addendum records backend-layer progress only.

### 9.8 B2-REM-3 Closure Addendum (2026-03-10)

**B2-REM-3 — ✅ CLOSED as of 2026-03-10**  
**Commit:** a198256  
**Scope:** Frontend enum / routing alignment layer only.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Files changed | `types.ts`; `services/authService.ts`; `services/controlPlaneService.ts`; `App.tsx` |
| `types.ts` | `TenantType` enum: `INTERNAL` added; `WHITE_LABEL` removed; enum now canonical with `AGGREGATOR / B2B / B2C / INTERNAL` |
| `authService.ts` | `currentTenant` construction updated: `tenant_category` + `is_white_label` consumed from login response; compat fields retained |
| `controlPlaneService.ts` | Canonical identity fields consumed in control-plane service layer |
| `App.tsx` — `resolveExperienceShell()` | Introduced as sole shell routing authority; takes `(tenant_category, is_white_label)` as inputs; `INTERNAL` → `AggregatorShell` via explicit named rule; `is_white_label === true` → `WhiteLabelShell`; `AGGREGATOR` → `AggregatorShell`; `B2B` → `B2BShell`; `B2C` → `B2CShell`; unknown → returns `null` (explicit error UI, no silent fallback) |
| White-label routing fix | `t.is_white_label === true` replaces stale `TenantType.WHITE_LABEL` identity check — regression closed |
| Silent fallback removal | `default:` fallback removed from shell routing; unknown identity now surfaces explicit ⚠️ error UI |
| Compat preservation | Legacy `tenantType` / `tenant.type` compat bridge preserved — no breaking change to downstream consumers |
| Validation | typecheck 0 errors; `GET /health` HTTP 200 |
| Atomicity | One atomic commit (a198256); 79 insertions / 35 deletions |
| org_id / RLS posture | Unchanged — no RLS policy or tenant isolation logic modified |

**PW5-V3-DEF-001 — ✅ CLOSED**  
`INTERNAL` tenant category now has an explicit frontend shell: `resolveExperienceShell('INTERNAL', false)` → `AggregatorShell` via named rule. Silent fallback was the prior risk; it is now removed. Defect fully resolved by B2-REM-3.

**PW5-V3-DEF-002 — Partially Remediated at Schema + Backend + Frontend Layers**  
Schema layer (B2-REM-1), backend serialization layer (B2-REM-2), and frontend routing layer (B2-REM-3) are now complete. Full defect closure is **not yet achieved**. Remaining layers still open:

| Layer | Unit | Status |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAPI / contract synchronization | B2-REM-4 | ⏳ Pending |
| Provisioning flow update | B2-REM-5 | ⏳ Pending |

**PW5-V3-DEF-003 — NO CHANGE — ✅ CLOSED**  
Closed by B2-REM-2 (commit efbce82). No change in this addendum.

**PW5-V3 — ❌ FAIL Overall**  
PW5-V3 remains ❌ FAIL overall. B2-REM-3 closes the frontend routing layer. B2-REM-4 and B2-REM-5 must be completed before PW5-V3 can be transitioned to PASS. This addendum records frontend-layer progress only.

### 9.9 B2-REM-4 Closure Addendum (2026-03-10)

**B2-REM-4 — ✅ CLOSED as of 2026-03-10**  
**Commit:** d5d6f84  
**Scope:** OpenAPI contract synchronization layer only.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Files changed | `shared/contracts/openapi.tenant.json`; `shared/contracts/openapi.control-plane.json` |
| Insertions / deletions | 171 insertions / 5 deletions |

| `MeSuccessResponse` (tenant contract) | Fields: `success`; `data.user`; `data.tenant` (containing `tenant_category`, `is_white_label`, `type` — `deprecated: true`, `status`, `plan`); `data.role` |
| `TenantObject` (control-plane contract) | Fields: `id`; `slug`; `name`; `tenant_category` (enum: AGGREGATOR / B2B / B2C / INTERNAL); `is_white_label` (boolean); `status`; `plan` |
| Tenant contract wiring | `POST /api/auth/login` 200 → `LoginSuccessResponse`; `POST /api/auth/tenant/login` 200 → `LoginSuccessResponse`; `GET /api/me` 200 → `MeSuccessResponse` |
| Control-plane contract wiring | `GET /api/control/tenants` 200 → array of `TenantObject`; `GET /api/control/tenants/{id}` 200 → `TenantObject` |
| Legacy compat preservation | `tenantType` retained in `LoginSuccessResponse` with `deprecated: true`; `type` retained in `MeSuccessResponse.data.tenant` with `deprecated: true` |
| Provisioning endpoint | `/api/control/tenants/provision` intentionally excluded from this unit — stale `type` enum preserved as-is; full alignment is B2-REM-5 scope |
| Validation | JSON parse PASS (both files); schema strings confirmed via grep; provision block confirmed untouched; `git diff --name-only`: 2 files only |
| Atomicity | One atomic commit (d5d6f84) |
| org_id / RLS posture | Unchanged — documentation-layer change only; no runtime, route, or query logic modified |

**PW5-V3-DEF-001 — NO CHANGE — ✅ CLOSED**  
Closed by B2-REM-3 (commit a198256). No change in this addendum.

**PW5-V3-DEF-002 — Partially Remediated at Schema + Backend + Frontend + OpenAPI Layers**

### 9.14 PW5-U2 WL Storefront Residual Cleanup + PW5-U1..U4 Retroactive Closure Verification (2026-03-10)

**Purpose:** This section records: (1) removal of the deprecated `case TenantType.WHITE_LABEL:` dead storefront content block from App.tsx — a PW5-V3 residual item deferred at time of canonicalization — supplementary to the PW5-U2 dead-affordance scope; (2) retroactive verification that PW5-U3 (dead CP action gating, commit **d5ee430**, 2026-03-09) and PW5-U4 (static CP panel removal, commit **3e2e14d**, 2026-03-09) were already resolved before this session and are confirmed closed; and (3) confirmation that PW5-U1 (B2C cart badge) is wired via the existing `useCart()` hook — no code change required. Block Condition 2 is met by the combination of d5ee430 + 3e2e14d + 024e5c5.

#### Unit-by-Unit Closure Table

| Unit | Target | Action | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| PW5-U2 / U2-REM-1 | B2BShell Negotiations + Invoices nav items | Repo inspection | NOT PRESENT in Shells.tsx — defect class absent; no code change needed |
| PW5-U2 / U2-REM-2 | AggregatorShell Post RFQ CTA | Repo inspection | NOT PRESENT in Shells.tsx — defect class absent (Note: AggregatorShell dead Certifications button resolved in GOVERNANCE-SYNC-114); no code change needed |
| PW5-U2 / U2-REM-3 | WhiteLabelShell Collections + The Journal nav items | Repo inspection | NOT PRESENT in Shells.tsx — defect class absent; no code change needed |
| PW5-U2 / Dead storefront | App.tsx `case TenantType.WHITE_LABEL:` decorative block | REMOVED | Dead storefront eliminated — "Explore the Collection" button had no onClick, no implementation path, unreachable post B2-REM-3; 35 lines removed |
| PW5-U1 / U1-VERIFY | B2CShell cart badge runtime wiring (PW5-U1 confirmation) | Confirmed wired | B2CShell already uses `const { itemCount } = useCart()` — badge correctly reflects CartContext.itemCount; no code change required; PW5-U1 satisfied by existing implementation |
| PW5-U3 (pre-session) | Dead CP action gating — commit **d5ee430** (2026-03-09) | Already resolved | TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE ✅ (AI Governance kill switch + secondary buttons gated) + TECS-FBW-ADMINRBAC ✅ (Invite Admin / Revoke buttons gated) + TECS-FBW-012 ✅ (Edit Access dead button hidden); all three resolved under d5ee430 (2026-03-09); retroactively recorded here |
| PW5-U4 (pre-session) | Static CP panels removed from nav — commit **3e2e14d** (2026-03-09) | Already resolved | TECS-FBW-PLACEHOLDER-PANELS ✅ (ArchitectureBlueprints, BackendSkeleton, ApiDocs, DataModel, MiddlewareScaffold removed from SuperAdmin nav; component files preserved on disk); resolved under 3e2e14d (2026-03-09); retroactively recorded here |

#### Evidence Summary

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| git diff --name-only (implementation) | App.tsx only |
| App.tsx change | 5 insertions / 35 deletions — dead case WHITE_LABEL block removed |
| Shells.tsx | Unchanged — named dead nav items verified absent |
| B2CShell cart badge | `useCart().itemCount` confirmed in Shells.tsx |
| typecheck (frontend + server) | EXIT 0 |
| Backend changes | None |
| Schema changes | None |
| Auth/session changes | None |

#### Validation Summary

- Frontend typecheck: PASS (EXIT 0)
- Server typecheck: PASS (EXIT 0)
- No new providers, contexts, or backend routes introduced
- No routing or state-machine changes
- Existing cart open/checkout behavior unchanged
- Named dead nav items (Negotiations, Invoices, Post RFQ, Collections, The Journal) NOT FOUND in current Shells.tsx — verified absent at implementation time

#### Block Condition Decision

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| Block Condition 1 — Verification tranche complete | ✅ MET (2026-03-10) |
| Block Condition 2 — Dead UI gating tranche complete | ✅ MET (2026-03-10) |
| Wave 5 Architecture sequencing | ✅ UNBLOCKED |

#### Deferred Items (Remain Deferred — Non-Blocking)

| Item | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Tenant logout path (DEF-003) | DEFERRED — separate UX scope |
| B2B profile/avatar action (DEF-004) | DEFERRED — separate UX scope |
| B2C search behavior (DEF-005) | DEFERRED — separate UX scope |
| WL storefront home/catalog completion (PW5-WL1) | DEFERRED — storefront completion work, not dead-affordance fix |
| DPP backend truth audit | DEFERRED — backend audit scope |
| Control-plane AdminRBAC / AiGovernance dead buttons | ✅ ALREADY RESOLVED — PW5-U3 (d5ee430, 2026-03-09); buttons gated/hidden in AiGovernance.tsx and AdminRBAC.tsx; backend design gate preserved; no further action needed in this unit |

#### Follow-on Sequencing

Block Condition 2 MET. Note: PW5-U3 (dead CP action gating, d5ee430, 2026-03-09) and PW5-U4 (static CP panels removal, 3e2e14d, 2026-03-09) were already completed prior to this session and are retroactively confirmed. Next sequenced units:
- **PW5-CP-PLAN** — control-plane re-baseline (now unblocked)
- **PW5-W series** — wiring tranche (PW5-W1..W4, backend-design-gated)

### Capability Classification

| Class | Count | Panels |
|---|---|---|
| OPERATIONAL — full read + mutation | 6 | Tenants · Feature Flags · Finance & Fees · Compliance Queue · Dispute Cases · Escalation Oversight |
| OPERATIONAL — read-only governance | 8 | Cart Summaries · Escrow Accounts · Cert Lifecycle · Traceability · Maker-Checker · Live Event Stream · Audit Logs · System Health |
| PARTIAL — no dedicated backend API | 2 | AI Governance · RBAC / Access Control |
| BACKEND DESIGN GATE | 1 | Settlement Admin (three-layer absence: no AdminView token · no component · no GET route) |

### Architectural Drift Observations

| # | Observation | Location | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cart-Summaries route registered outside `controlRoutes` Fastify plugin — in `server/src/index.ts` directly | `server/src/index.ts` L148 | MEDIUM — future middleware additions to controlRoutes will not apply automatically |
| 2 | Maker-Checker dual-prefix internal bridge (`/api/internal/gov/` + `/api/control/internal/gov/`) not documented in OpenAPI contract | `server/src/routes/internal/makerChecker.ts` | LOW — undocumented API surface |
| 3 | AI Governance panel derives data from `GET /api/control/tenants`; no dedicated AI backend route; prompt registry is a hardcoded static array | `components/ControlPlane/AiGovernance.tsx` | MEDIUM — panel is cosmetic overlay of tenants data |
| 4 | RBAC panel renders from `ADMIN_USERS` constant; no backend API; no live data | `components/ControlPlane/AdminRBAC.tsx` | HIGH — not live data; governance surface is inert |
| 5 | Settlement Admin surface absent across all three layers: no AdminView token, no component, no GET route | (absent) | HIGH — tracker previously understated this as only "missing read route" |
| 6 | `POST /api/control/escrows` (escrow.g018.ts L222) exists but is undocumented and not referenced by any frontend consumer | `server/src/routes/control/escrow.g018.ts` L222 | MEDIUM — auth tier and idempotency posture unverified |
| 7 | `POST /api/control/trades/:id/transition` exists and is intentionally not wired in `TradeOversight.tsx` per wiring tranche constraint | `server/src/routes/control/trades.g017.ts` L161 | LOW — intentional; not documented as such in governance |
| 8 | VER-003 / VER-004 OpenAPI drift — ≥12 Wave 3–5 control-plane routes are likely absent from `openapi.control-plane.json` | `shared/contracts/openapi.control-plane.json` | HIGH — governance documentation gap; priority elevated |

### New Gap Register Entries Created

Five new entries registered in `governance/gap-register.md` under "PW5-CP-PLAN Architectural Drift Findings":

- **AI_GOV-BACKEND-001** — OPEN design gate; no dedicated AI governance backend route
- **RBAC-BACKEND-001** — OPEN design gate; `AdminRBAC.tsx` renders from constant; no live API
- **ESCROW-POST-001** — OPEN investigation; POST /api/control/escrows undocumented; auth/idempotency unverified
- **TRADES-MUTATION-DEFERRED** — DEFERRED; `POST /api/control/trades/:id/transition` backend-ready; frontend not designed
- **MAKER-CHECKER-MUTATION-DEFERRED** — DEFERRED; sign/replay mutation routes backend-ready; frontend not designed

### Governance Impact

VER-003 / VER-004 OpenAPI drift verification priority elevated to "recommended immediate next unit" in both tracker and gap register. Settlement Admin (PW5-W3) reclassified from "BACKEND_EXISTS_UI_MISSING" to three-layer absence (no token · no component · no GET route) — this is a more severe classification. PW5-W2 ✅ CLOSED · PW5-W4 ✅ CLOSED · PW5-W3 🔴 BACKEND DESIGN GATE.

## Section 9.16 — SPEC-SYNC OpenAPI Reconciliation — 2026-03-10

**Unit:** SPEC-SYNC-TENANT / SPEC-SYNC-CONTROL | **Type:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC — Documentation Only | **Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Governance Sync:** SPEC-SYNC-GOV | **Files Modified:** `shared/contracts/openapi.tenant.json` · `shared/contracts/openapi.control-plane.json` (no product code changes)

### A — Inputs

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| VER-003 — OpenAPI tenant contract drift enumeration | ✅ COMPLETE — 22 runtime routes absent from openapi.tenant.json confirmed |
| VER-004 — OpenAPI control-plane contract drift enumeration | ✅ COMPLETE — 20 runtime routes absent from openapi.control-plane.json confirmed |
| SPEC-SYNC commit | 88ba3e7c1e02d6671a20b390325edec696b6cf23 |
| Commit message | docs(openapi): synchronize tenant and control-plane OpenAPI specs with runtime routes (VER-003 / VER-004) |
| Files changed | shared/contracts/openapi.tenant.json (+642 lines) · shared/contracts/openapi.control-plane.json (+576 lines) |
| Total insertions | 1218 insertions(+), 0 deletions |

### B — Result

Tenant and control-plane OpenAPI documents updated to reflect deterministic runtime-route drift identified in VER-003 / VER-004. All non-decision routes confirmed in VER-003 and VER-004 are now represented in the respective OpenAPI contracts.

| Contract | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| openapi.tenant.json | 22 runtime routes absent | SYNCHRONIZED — deterministic drift remediated |
| openapi.control-plane.json | 20 runtime routes absent | SYNCHRONIZED — deterministic drift remediated |

### C — Residual Decisions (OPEN — DECISION REQUIRED)

Two policy-class residuals were explicitly NOT resolved in this tranche and remain open pending governance decision:

| ID | Classification | Description |
|---|---|---|
| OPENAPI-AI-SCOPE-001 | DECISION REQUIRED | `/api/ai/*` routes remain in `openapi.tenant.json`; no dedicated `openapi.ai.json` exists; contract ownership unresolved |
| OPENAPI-IMPERSONATION-DOC-001 | DECISION REQUIRED | `POST /api/control/impersonation/start` + `/stop` are live SUPER_ADMIN endpoints; intentionally absent from `openapi.control-plane.json` pending governance decision on public documentation policy |

### D — Validation Status

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| JSON syntax validation — openapi.tenant.json | ✅ CONFIRMED — `node JSON.parse`: TENANT_JSON:VALID |
| JSON syntax validation — openapi.control-plane.json | ✅ CONFIRMED — `node JSON.parse`: CONTROL_JSON:VALID |
| Semantic OpenAPI validation (schema correctness, $ref resolution, etc.) | ⚠️ PENDING — no OpenAPI-aware validator (e.g., Spectral, swagger-parser) was executed in this unit; only JSON syntax was verified |

### E — Audit-Safe Conclusion

Deterministic OpenAPI drift identified by VER-003 / VER-004 has been synchronized. Two policy-class residuals remain open pending governance decision. The contracts are syntactically valid JSON. Semantic OpenAPI correctness is unverified in this unit.

## Section 9.17 — OpenAPI Policy Decision Closure — 2026-03-10

**Unit:** OPENAPI-POLICY-DECISION-GOV | **Type:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC — Decision Recording Only | **Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Files Modified:** `docs/governance/IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-03.md` · `governance/gap-register.md` · `docs/governance/audits/2026-03-audit-reconciliation-matrix.md` (no product code; no OpenAPI files)

### A — Inputs

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| VER-003 — OpenAPI tenant contract drift enumeration | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-10 |
| VER-004 — OpenAPI control-plane contract drift enumeration | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-10 |
| SPEC-SYNC — deterministic OpenAPI drift synchronization | ✅ COMPLETE — commit 88ba3e7c1e02d6671a20b390325edec696b6cf23 |
| SPEC-SYNC-GOV — governance recording of SPEC-SYNC + residual registration | ✅ COMPLETE — commit 2a8b25ad |
| Residuals carried into this unit | OPENAPI-AI-SCOPE-001 · OPENAPI-IMPERSONATION-DOC-001 |

### B — Decision Outcomes

| Gap ID | Decision | Final Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| OPENAPI-AI-SCOPE-001 | CLOSED / RESOLVED (policy decision) | `/api/ai/*` retained in `openapi.tenant.json` as tenant-consumable cross-cutting product routes. Future extraction to a dedicated AI contract remains allowed if AI contract ownership is formally re-baselined. |
| OPENAPI-IMPERSONATION-DOC-001 | CLOSED / RESOLVED (policy decision) | `POST /api/control/impersonation/start` and `/stop` remain intentionally excluded from `openapi.control-plane.json` due to sensitive SUPER_ADMIN operational scope. Omission from public contract is accepted governance policy. Route truth preserved in VER-004 findings and gap-register. |

### C — Closure Type

- Policy decision only — no runtime changes performed
- No OpenAPI files modified in this unit (`shared/contracts/*` not touched)
- No product code changes (frontend, backend, schema, RLS)
- Closure is by governance authority, not implementation

### D — Sequencing Impact

| Impact | Status |
|---|---|
| OPENAPI-AI-SCOPE-001 governance blocker | ✅ REMOVED |
| OPENAPI-IMPERSONATION-DOC-001 governance blocker | ✅ REMOVED |
| Next unit unblocked | **PW5-W3 backend design** — Settlement Admin: define `GET /api/control/settlements` read route (three-layer absence: no AdminView token · no component · no GET route) |

### E — Audit-Safe Conclusion

Two policy-class OpenAPI residuals identified after SPEC-SYNC were resolved by governance decision. No contract files or runtime files were modified in this decision-recording unit. The PW5-W3 backend design gate is now the sole remaining blocker for Settlement Admin sequencing.

## Section 9.18 — PW5-W3 Backend Read Surface Closure — 2026-03-12

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-W3-GOV | **Type:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC — Documentation Only | **Date:** 2026-03-12
**Files Modified:** `docs/governance/IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-03.md` · `governance/gap-register.md` · `docs/governance/audits/2026-03-audit-reconciliation-matrix.md` (no product code; no OpenAPI files modified in this unit)

### A — Inputs

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| PW5-W3 backend design report — Settlement Admin backend design gate | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-10 (PW5-CP-PLAN; three-layer absence confirmed: no AdminView token · no component · no GET route) |
| PW5-W3-IMPL — commit 14aea49 | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-12 · `feat(control-plane): add settlement admin read route` |

### B — Implementation Result

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/control/settlements` added in `server/src/routes/control/settlement.ts` | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| Control-plane OpenAPI contract updated | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| Backend-only tranche respected — no frontend wiring performed | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| No schema changes | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| No migration files | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| No settlement detail route | ✅ CONFIRMED |

### C — Remaining Scope

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Frontend Settlement Admin component | ❌ Not yet implemented |
| AdminView token (`SETTLEMENT_ADMIN`) | ❌ Not yet implemented |
| Shell nav wiring for Settlement Admin | ❌ Not yet implemented |
| Settlement detail endpoint | ❌ Not implemented — not in scope for PW5-W3-BE |

### D — Sequencing Impact

| Impact | Status |
|---|---|
| Backend design gate removed | ✅ GATE REMOVED — 2026-03-12 |
| PW5-W3 row split into PW5-W3-BE + PW5-W3-FE | ✅ RECORDED |
| Next sequenced unit | **PW5-W3-FE — Settlement Admin frontend wiring** |
| Prior sequenced unit (PW5-W3 backend design) | ✅ RETIRED — superseded by PW5-W3-BE closure |

### E — Audit-Safe Conclusion

The Settlement Admin backend read surface was implemented and documented. The prior backend design gate is removed. `GET /api/control/settlements` now exists in the control-plane route surface. The control-plane OpenAPI contract has been updated. The backend-only tranche was respected throughout PW5-W3-IMPL — no frontend wiring, no schema changes, no migration files, and no settlement detail route were included. Remaining PW5-W3 work is frontend wiring only (PW5-W3-FE).

*Updated: 2026-03-12 — PW5-W3 runtime verification closure recorded (Section 9.19); PW5-W3 FULLY CLOSED end-to-end; three non-blocking follow-ups recorded · commit 8f4a685 (PW5-W3-FE) · verification PASS · next unit: PW5-WL1 (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-W3-VERIFY-GOV)*

## Section 9.19 — PW5-W3 Runtime Verification Closure — 2026-03-12

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-W3-VERIFY-GOV  
**Date:** 2026-03-12  
**Type:** Governance-only documentation update; no product code changed

### A — Inputs

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| PW5-W3 backend design report (PW5-CP-PLAN · 2026-03-10) | ✅ COMPLETE — three-layer absence confirmed |
| PW5-W3-IMPL — commit 14aea49 | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-12 · `GET /api/control/settlements` implemented |
| PW5-W3-GOV — commit de501e8 | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-12 · 3 governance artifacts updated |

| PW5-W3-VERIFY report | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-12 · all acceptance criteria confirmed |

### B — Verification Result

| Acceptance Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| Settlement Admin navigable from control-plane shell | PASS |
| API auth guard active — 401 on unauthenticated probe | PASS |
| Response schema matches implemented contract | PASS |
| 8-column table renders (Settlement ID · Tenant ID · Escrow ID · Reference ID · Amount · Currency · Created At · Created By) | PASS |
| Cursor pagination logic correct (opaque base64url token · compound predicate) | PASS |
| Cross-tenant admin read posture confirmed (withSettlementAdminContext RLS pattern) | PASS |
| No blocking console / server / runtime errors | PASS |
| 8/8 integration tests PASS (S-001–S-008) | PASS |
| GET /health 200 confirmed | PASS |

**End-to-end verdict: PASS**

### C — Non-Blocking Observations

| ID | Description | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| OBS-1 / PW5-W3-TYPE-ALIGN-001 | `amount: number` interface in `controlPlaneService.ts` vs `Decimal.toString()` server serialization — runtime-safe; `Intl.NumberFormat.format()` handles string input correctly | NON-BLOCKING FOLLOW-UP |
| OBS-2 / PW5-W3-TEST-001 | No dedicated integration test for `GET /api/control/settlements`; existing suite covers S-001–S-008 (POST routes only) | NON-BLOCKING FOLLOW-UP |
| PW5-W3-PERF-INDEX | Compound partial index `(created_at DESC, id DESC) WHERE entry_type='RELEASE' AND direction='DEBIT'` absent on `escrow_transactions`; non-blocking at current ledger volume | FUTURE PERFORMANCE UNIT |

### D — Closure State

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| PW5-W3-BE | ✅ FULLY CLOSED — commit 14aea49 |
| PW5-W3-FE | ✅ FULLY CLOSED — commit 8f4a685 |
| PW5-W3-VERIFY | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-12 |
| PW5-W3 (overall) | ✅ FULLY CLOSED end-to-end — 2026-03-12 |
| OBS-1 / PW5-W3-TYPE-ALIGN-001 | DEFERRED — non-blocking |
| OBS-2 / PW5-W3-TEST-001 | DEFERRED — non-blocking |
| PW5-W3-PERF-INDEX | DEFERRED — future performance unit; non-blocking |

### E — Audit-Safe Conclusion

PW5-W3 runtime verification passed. Settlement Admin is operational. Three non-blocking follow-up items were recorded separately and do not prevent tranche closure. The full PW5-W3 chain — backend design, backend implementation, OpenAPI contract, frontend panel, and runtime verification — is complete. Settlement Admin is navigable from the control-plane shell, auth-guarded, schema-compliant, and reads correctly across tenant boundaries using the `withSettlementAdminContext` pattern.

## Section 9.20 — PW5-WL1 White-Label Storefront Verification — 2026-03-12

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL1-GOV  
**Date:** 2026-03-12  
**Type:** Governance-only documentation update; no product code changed in this unit

### A — Inputs

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| PW5-WL1 implementation — commit cc4278f | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-12 · `feat(wl-storefront): implement white-label product grid` |
| Components created | ✅ `components/WL/ProductCard.tsx` NEW · `components/WL/ProductGrid.tsx` NEW · `components/WL/WLStorefront.tsx` NEW |
| App.tsx wiring | ✅ Import added + WL HOME guard: `if (currentTenant.is_white_label && expView === 'HOME') return <WLStorefront />;` |
| Catalog service | ✅ `getCatalogItems()` via `tenantGet('/api/tenant/catalog/items')` — pre-existing, unchanged |
| Server catalog route | ✅ `GET /api/tenant/catalog/items` in `server/src/routes/tenant.ts` · `withDbContext` + PostgreSQL RLS · no manual tenantId filter |
| Runtime health check | ✅ `GET /health` → HTTP 200 confirmed |

### B — Implementation Result

| Acceptance Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| WL HOME guard intercepts before category switch | PASS — `if (currentTenant.is_white_label && expView === 'HOME')` is above the `switch (currentTenant.tenant_category)` block |
| WLStorefront renders ProductGrid | PASS — `WLStorefront.tsx` renders `<ProductGrid />` with page heading |
| getCatalogItems() calls correct endpoint | PASS — `tenantGet<CatalogResponse>('/api/tenant/catalog/items')` |
| No clientside tenantId in catalog request | PASS — D-017-A compliant; tenant scope resolved server-side from JWT |
| Server RLS enforces isolation | PASS — `withDbContext(prisma, request.dbContext, ...)` sets `app.current_org_id()` for PostgreSQL RLS |
| Auth guard active (fail-closed) | PASS — 401 returned on unauthenticated catalog probe |
| Loading / error / empty states implemented | PASS — ProductGrid.tsx handles all three states |
| Responsive grid layout | PASS — `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4` |
| TypeCheck + Lint gate | PASS — typecheck EXIT 0 · lint EXIT 0 at commit time |

**End-to-end verdict: PASS**

### C — Runtime Verification Outcome

| Check | Outcome |
|---|---|
| GET /health | HTTP 200 |
| Unauthenticated GET /api/tenant/catalog/items | HTTP 401 (auth guard active) |
| WL HOME guard position in renderExperienceContent() | Above `switch (currentTenant.tenant_category)` — correct intercept order confirmed by static inspection |
| RLS integration test coverage | Three test suites confirm catalog_items isolation: wave3-rls-negative.spec.ts · tenant-catalog-items.rls.integration.test.ts · rls-catalog-items.smoke.integration.test.ts |

### D — Observations (Non-Blocking)

| ID | Description | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| CAT-SCHEMA-001 | `imageUrl?: string` and `category?: string` are optional in `CatalogItem` interface; `ProductCard.tsx` guards both with conditional rendering — no UI error if absent | NON-BLOCKING OBSERVATION |
| CAT-SCHEMA-002 | `moq?: number` is optional; `ProductCard.tsx` renders MOQ badge only when `item.moq != null` — null-safe | NON-BLOCKING OBSERVATION |
| CAT-SCHEMA-003 | `currency` field not rendered in ProductCard; `formatPrice()` uses `Intl.NumberFormat` with locale default — acceptable for v1 WL storefront; currency display alignment is a future enhancement, not a defect | NON-BLOCKING OBSERVATION |

All three observations (CAT-SCHEMA-001, CAT-SCHEMA-002, CAT-SCHEMA-003) are non-blocking and do not affect functional correctness or tenant isolation. No gap register entries created for these items; they are recorded here as audit observations only.

### E — Audit-Safe Conclusion

PW5-WL1 runtime verification passed. WL storefront product grid is operational. All nine acceptance criteria confirmed. Three non-blocking catalog schema observations recorded (CAT-SCHEMA-001/002/003) — none affect correctness or isolation. The full PW5-WL1 chain — component implementation (ProductCard/ProductGrid/WLStorefront), App.tsx wiring (WL HOME guard above category switch), and runtime verification — is complete. The WL storefront is navigable for `is_white_label` tenants, auth-guarded at the API layer, RLS-enforced at the database layer, and D-017-A compliant throughout. **PW5-WL1 FULLY CLOSED.**

## Section 9.21 — PW5-WL2 Category Browsing Verification — 2026-03-13

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL2-GOV  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Type:** Governance-only documentation update; no product code changed in this unit

### A — Inputs

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| PW5-WL2 implementation — commit 3070f80 | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · `feat(wl-storefront): implement category collections navigation` |
| PW5-WL1 implementation (parent) — commit cc4278f | ✅ FULLY CLOSED — 2026-03-12 |
| Components modified | ✅ `components/WL/WLCollectionsPanel.tsx` NEW · `components/WL/WLStorefront.tsx` rewritten · `components/WL/ProductGrid.tsx` converted to pure render |
| No backend / schema / OpenAPI changes | ✅ Confirmed — 3 frontend WL files only |
| PW5-WL2-VERIFY report | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · all 9 ACs confirmed |

### B — Implementation Result

| Component | Change | Architectural Role |
|---|---|---|
| `WLCollectionsPanel.tsx` | NEW | Pure prop-driven category nav — no `getCatalogItems` import; no internal fetch |
| `WLStorefront.tsx` | Rewritten | Single data owner — fetches once via `getCatalogItems()`; owns `items`, `activeCategory`; derives `categories` + `filteredItems` via `useMemo` |
| `ProductGrid.tsx` | Converted | Pure render component — receives `items: CatalogItem[]` prop; `getCatalogItems` removed entirely |

No backend, schema, migration, OpenAPI, or governance files changed in the implementation commit.

### C — Runtime Verification Outcome

| Acceptance Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| WLCollectionsPanel renders above ProductGrid | PASS |
| Category grouping computed from items dataset (client-side) | PASS |
| Fallback “Uncategorised” applied — all 14 items, no runtime category field | PASS |
| Category click filters ProductGrid items | PASS — `setActiveCategory` triggers `filteredItems` useMemo recompute — no API call |
| Default state (`activeCategory = null`) shows all products | PASS |
| Catalog API called exactly once | PASS — single `getCatalogItems()` in `WLStorefront.loadItems` (useCallback deps `[]`) |
| Category change triggers zero additional API calls | PASS — `onSelectCategory` mutates state only; no fetch in callback chain |
| Tenant isolation preserved — no client-side tenantId | PASS — D-017-A compliant; JWT-scoped; server RLS active |
| No console / server / runtime errors | PASS |
| GET /health 200 | PASS |

**End-to-end verdict: PASS**

### D — Observations (Non-Blocking)

| ID | Description | PW5-WL2 Status |
|---|---|---|
| CAT-SCHEMA-001 | `imageUrl?: string` and `category?: string` optional in `CatalogItem`; field guards in `ProductCard.tsx` confirmed effective | NON-BLOCKING — reaffirmed by PW5-WL2 runtime: `resolveCategory()` fallback handles `category: undefined` correctly |
| CAT-SCHEMA-002 | `moq?: number` optional; MOQ badge guarded with `item.moq != null` | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged; no new risk introduced |
| CAT-SCHEMA-003 | `currency` not rendered in ProductCard; `Intl.NumberFormat` locale default | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged; no new risk introduced |

No new CAT-SCHEMA IDs introduced. PW5-WL2 runtime verification confirms the fallback design (`(item.category ?? '').trim() || 'Uncategorised'`) is correct and handles the zero-category schema state gracefully. When a `category` column is added to `catalog_items` in a future schema unit, the storefront will automatically display real category groups without any component changes.

### E — Audit-Safe Conclusion

PW5-WL2 runtime verification passed. WL storefront category browsing is operational. Single-fetch storefront architecture is confirmed: `WLStorefront` owns catalog data; `WLCollectionsPanel` and `ProductGrid` are prop-driven only; no duplicate-fetch path exists at the structural level. Existing catalog schema observations (CAT-SCHEMA-001/002/003) remain non-blocking and do not prevent tranche closure. The `resolveCategory()` fallback handles the current absent-category schema state correctly. **PW5-WL2 FULLY CLOSED.**

## Section 9.22 — PW5-WL3 Product Detail Page Verification — 2026-03-13

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL3-GOV  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Type:** Governance-only documentation update; no product code changed in this unit

### A — Inputs

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| PW5-WL3 implementation — commit 06fd294 | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · `feat(wl-storefront): implement PW5-WL3 product detail page` |
| PW5-WL2 implementation (parent) — commit 3070f80 | ✅ FULLY CLOSED — 2026-03-13 |
| Components modified | ✅ `components/WL/WLProductDetailPage.tsx` NEW · `components/WL/WLStorefront.tsx` extended · `components/WL/ProductGrid.tsx` extended · `components/WL/ProductCard.tsx` extended |
| No backend / schema / OpenAPI changes | ✅ Confirmed — 4 frontend WL files only (git show --stat HEAD) |
| PW5-WL3-VERIFY report | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · all 10 ACs confirmed |

### B — Implementation Result

| Component | Change | Architectural Role |
|---|---|---|
| `WLProductDetailPage.tsx` | NEW | Pure presentational detail view — no API import; no fetch; receives `item: CatalogItem` prop from WLStorefront + `onBack` callback |
| `WLStorefront.tsx` | Extended | Added `selectedItemId` state; `selectedItem` derived via `useMemo(items.find)` from already-fetched state — no secondary fetch; `handleSelectItem`/`handleBackFromDetail` callbacks; detail-view and graceful not-found render paths |
| `ProductGrid.tsx` | Extended | Optional `onSelectItem?: (id: string) => void` prop — forwarded to `ProductCard`; no fetch added |
| `ProductCard.tsx` | Extended | Optional `onSelect?: () => void` prop — card becomes interactive; keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space + tabIndex); no fetch added |

Data flow: `Catalog API → WLStorefront state → useMemo derived selectedItem → WLProductDetailPage`. No duplicate requests. No child component owns catalog data.

No backend, schema, migration, OpenAPI, or governance files changed in the implementation commit.

### C — Verification Outcome

| Check | Detail | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Network | Single catalog request only; no per-item fetch; no duplicate request on selection or back navigation | PASS |
| Runtime | Card → detail view correct; back navigation restores grid + preserves activeCategory; stale/invalid ID renders graceful not-found with back button | PASS |
| Tenant safety | No `tenantId` reference in any of the 4 touched files; tenant scope resolved via server JWT (D-017-A) | PASS |
| Architecture | `WLProductDetailPage`, `ProductGrid`, `ProductCard` are presentation-only; no API imports; no fetch calls; WLStorefront is sole catalog fetch owner | PASS |
| Regression | WL category browsing and filtered grid intact; no UI flicker from repeated fetching; no `<img>` tags introduced; no app-wide style changes | PASS |
| Build quality | `tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; `eslint --max-warnings 0` EXIT 0 on all 4 touched files; no dead imports | PASS |

**End-to-end verdict: PASS**

### D — Observations (Non-Blocking)

| ID | Description | PW5-WL3 Status |
|---|---|---|
| CAT-SCHEMA-001 | `imageUrl` absent from current schema; `WLProductDetailPage.tsx` deliberately excludes image rendering | NON-BLOCKING — reaffirmed; no broken-image placeholder introduced |
| CAT-SCHEMA-002 | `moq?: number` optional; `WLProductDetailPage` renders MOQ row only when `item.moq != null` | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |
| CAT-SCHEMA-003 | `currency` not rendered; `formatPrice()` uses `Intl.NumberFormat` locale default | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |

No new CAT-SCHEMA IDs introduced. Cart stub is non-destructive: `disabled`, `aria-disabled="true"`, `cursor-not-allowed`, no `onClick` handler — no cart API behavior exists in this unit.

### E — Audit-Safe Conclusion

PW5-WL3 verification passed. WL storefront product detail page is operational. The single-fetch storefront architecture remains intact: `WLStorefront` is the exclusive owner of catalog fetching; `selectedItem` is derived from already-held state via `useMemo` — no secondary network request is introduced at any point in the selection or back-navigation flow. Existing catalog schema observations (CAT-SCHEMA-001/002/003) remain non-blocking. The cart-foundation stub is non-destructive and introduces no cart API behavior. **PW5-WL3 FULLY CLOSED.**

*Updated: 2026-03-13 — PW5-WL3 product detail page verification closure recorded (Section 9.22); PW5-WL3 FULLY CLOSED; cart stub non-destructive confirmed; single-fetch architecture intact · commit 06fd294 · verification PASS · next unit: PW5-WL4 (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL3-GOV)*

## Section 9.23 — PW5-WL4 Product Search Verification — 2026-03-13

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL4-GOV  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Type:** Governance-only documentation update; no product code changed in this unit

### A — Inputs

| Input | Status |
|---|---|
| PW5-WL4 implementation — commit 25921ae | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · `feat(wl-storefront): implement PW5-WL4 product search` |
| PW5-WL3 implementation (parent) — commit 06fd294 | ✅ FULLY CLOSED — 2026-03-13 |
| Components modified | ✅ `components/WL/WLSearchBar.tsx` NEW · `components/WL/WLStorefront.tsx` extended · `components/WL/ProductGrid.tsx` extended |
| No backend / schema / OpenAPI changes | ✅ Confirmed — 3 frontend WL files only (git show --stat HEAD) |
| PW5-WL4-VERIFY report | ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-13 · all validation gates PASS |

### B — Implementation Result

| Component | Change | Architectural Role |
|---|---|---|
| `WLSearchBar.tsx` | NEW | Pure presentational controlled input — imports React only; no service clients; no useEffect; no API call on any user interaction; clear affordance; accessible sr-only label |
| `WLStorefront.tsx` | Extended | Added `searchQuery: string` state; derived `searchFilteredItems` via `useMemo([filteredItems, searchQuery])` — chained after category filter; renders `WLSearchBar` above `WLCollectionsPanel`; passes `searchFilteredItems` to `ProductGrid`; passes context-aware `emptyMessage` when search query active |
| `ProductGrid.tsx` | Extended | Optional `emptyMessage?: string` prop — backward-compatible; renders prop value when items empty; falls back to prior `'No products available'` copy when omitted |

Derivation order: `Catalog API → WLStorefront items state → filteredItems (useMemo/category) → searchFilteredItems (useMemo/searchQuery) → ProductGrid render`. No duplicate requests. No child component owns catalog data. Search never mutates `items` or `filteredItems`.

No backend, schema, migration, OpenAPI, or governance files changed in the implementation commit.

### C — Verification Outcome

| Check | Detail | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Network | Single catalog request only (`getCatalogItems()` once in `loadItems`/`useEffect`); no per-keystroke, per-category, per-selection, or per-back-navigation fetch; `WLSearchBar` imports React only — no service client; `ProductGrid` imports unchanged | PASS |
| Runtime | Typing updates results synchronously (no async path in `useMemo`); case-insensitive `f.toLowerCase().includes(q)` matching; `?? ''` guards on optional fields; empty query short-circuits to `filteredItems` unchanged; category + search compose deterministically (chained memos); empty-result `emptyMessage` distinguishes search-empty from catalogue-empty; detail navigation path unchanged (`selectedItemId`/`WLProductDetailPage`); `searchQuery` state survives back navigation (`setSelectedItemId(null)` does not reset `searchQuery`) | PASS |
| Tenant safety | No `tenantId` added to any component, prop, or request; `getCatalogItems()` called with no arguments; server resolves tenant scope exclusively from JWT via `requireTenantRealm()` (D-017-A) | PASS |
| Architecture | `WLStorefront` sole catalog fetch owner; `WLSearchBar` presentational-only (React import only); `ProductGrid` presentational-only (no fetch added); `searchFilteredItems` is `useMemo` — not state; derivation order correct: items → category → search → render | PASS |
| Regression | WL category browsing intact (`WLCollectionsPanel` props unchanged); WL detail page intact (selection/back path unchanged); no UI flicker from repeated fetching; no `<img>` tags or image assumptions introduced; no cart/checkout behavior added; `emptyMessage` prop on `ProductGrid` is optional with backward-compatible fallback | PASS |
| Build quality | `tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; `eslint` EXIT 0 on all three touched files; `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-only`: 3 files (components/WL/ only — no backend/schema/governance files); no dead imports; no unused state | PASS |

**End-to-end verdict: PASS**

### D — Observations (Non-Blocking)

| ID | Description | PW5-WL4 Status |
|---|---|---|
| CAT-SCHEMA-001 | `imageUrl` absent from current schema; `WLSearchBar` and search logic make no image assumptions | NON-BLOCKING — reaffirmed; unchanged |
| CAT-SCHEMA-002 | `moq?: number` optional; search logic uses `?? ''` guard on optional fields; MOQ not added as a searchable field | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |
| CAT-SCHEMA-003 | `currency` not rendered; search does not reference currency field | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |

No new CAT-SCHEMA IDs introduced. PW5-WL4 introduces no new gaps.

### E — Architectural Compliance Record

| Rule | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Single-fetch storefront | `WLStorefront` remains sole fetch owner; `searchFilteredItems` is pure `useMemo` derivation — no API call on keystroke, category change, or navigation |
| No duplicate requests | No per-keystroke fetch; no extra catalog requests on search/category/detail/back interactions |
| Tenant isolation (D-017-A) | No `tenantId` in client; tenant context JWT/server-derived; unchanged |
| Schema stability | No Prisma/schema/migration/seed/RLS files in implementation commit |
| Backend stability | No backend files in implementation commit; no new API routes; no remote search path |
| Behavioral integrity | Category browsing preserved; detail path preserved; empty search state graceful; no UI flicker |
| Build quality | `tsc --noEmit` clean; ESLint clean; 3 WL-only files in commit |

### F — Doctrine Alignment Note

PW5-WL4 remains aligned with current TexQtic doctrine and dashboard separation. White-label tenants are brand operators running storefront + back-office on TexQtic infrastructure. The storefront consumer UX is a separate rendering surface from WL Store Admin modules. This unit belongs to the storefront-consumer-facing WL surface, not the tenant dashboard matrix. No anti-bazaar, settlement, or AI-governance boundary is widened by this unit.

### G — Audit-Safe Conclusion

PW5-WL4 successfully extends the WL storefront from browse/detail capability into search-driven discoverability without expanding backend scope. The unit preserves the constitutional single-fetch storefront architecture by keeping search entirely client-side and derived from existing catalog state. No tenant isolation, schema, or backend boundaries were altered. Verification passed across network, runtime, architecture, regression, and build-quality checks. **PW5-WL4 FULLY CLOSED.**

## Section 9.24 — PW5-WL5: WL Cart / Checkout Foundation

**Governance Sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL5-GOV  
**Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Commit:** c40eb64  
**Commit Message:** `feat(wl-storefront): implement PW5-WL5 cart foundation`  
**Files Changed:** `components/WL/WLProductDetailPage.tsx` · `components/WL/WLStorefront.tsx` (2 files — WL components only)  
**Discovery class:** CASE A — existing CartContext / cartService / Cart.tsx reused without modification

### A — Implementation Summary

PW5-WL5 activates the WL storefront cart integration. The disabled cart stub introduced in PW5-WL3 (`WLProductDetailPage.tsx`) is converted into a live handler by wiring the existing `CartContext.addToCart` function through a new optional `onAddToCart` prop.

**`WLProductDetailPage.tsx` modified:**
- `onAddToCart?: (catalogItemId: string, quantity: number) => Promise<void>` optional prop added
- `quantity` state initialised to `Math.max(item.moq ?? 1, 1)` (MOQ floor enforced at init)
- Decrement guard: `Math.max(minQty, q - 1)` prevents quantity dropping below MOQ
- `adding` / `addSuccess` / `addError` feedback states for user-visible UX feedback
- `handleAddToCart` async callback: calls `onAddToCart(item.id, quantity)` with error boundary
- `addButtonLabel` pre-return `let` variable resolves `no-nested-ternary` ESLint rule
- Button disabled on `adding || !item.active`; `onAddToCart` absent → disabled placeholder rendered
- No service imports added; component remains purely presentational with prop-driven cart access

**`WLStorefront.tsx` modified:**
- `import { useCart } from '../../contexts/CartContext'` added
- `const { addToCart } = useCart()` destructured at component top
- `onAddToCart={addToCart}` passed to `WLProductDetailPage` in the detail render branch

**Unchanged (CASE A reuse):**
- `contexts/CartContext.tsx` — `CartProvider`, `useCart()`, `addToCart(catalogItemId, quantity)` reused as-is
- `services/cartService.ts` — `AddToCartRequest = { catalogItemId, quantity }` (no tenantId — D-017-A)
- `components/Cart/Cart.tsx` — full cart UI, checkout flow unchanged
- `App.tsx` — `CartProvider` wrapping `EXPERIENCE` case already present

### B — Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Gate | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Commit scope | Exactly 2 files (`components/WL/WLProductDetailPage.tsx` + `components/WL/WLStorefront.tsx`); no server/prisma/governance/schema files | PASS |
| Catalog fetch isolation | No `getCatalogItems` reference in `WLProductDetailPage.tsx`; `WLStorefront` remains sole catalog fetch owner | PASS |
| Tenant isolation (D-017-A) | `AddToCartRequest = { catalogItemId, quantity }` — no `tenantId`; `tenantId` absent from all WL component props and request bodies | PASS |
| CartContext contract | `addToCart(catalogItemId: string, quantity: number): Promise<void>` via `useCart()`; `CartProvider` wraps EXPERIENCE case in `App.tsx`; CASE A backward-compat reuse confirmed | PASS |
| MOQ floor | `quantity` state init: `Math.max(item.moq ?? 1, 1)`; decrement: `Math.max(minQty, q - 1)` prevents sub-MOQ; `?? 1` guards null/undefined `moq` | PASS |
| Button states | Disabled on `adding \|\| !item.active`; `onAddToCart` absent → disabled placeholder; `addButtonLabel` let variable avoids nested ternary | PASS |
| Build quality | `tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; `eslint --max-warnings=0` EXIT 0; `git show --stat c40eb64`: 2 files (105 insertions / 18 deletions) | PASS |

**End-to-end verdict: PASS**

### C — Observations (Non-Blocking)

| ID | Description | PW5-WL5 Status |
|---|---|---|
| CAT-SCHEMA-001 | `imageUrl` absent from current schema; WL detail page makes no image assumptions | NON-BLOCKING — reaffirmed; unchanged |
| CAT-SCHEMA-002 | `moq?: number` optional; `?? 1` guard applied at both MOQ floor init and quantity display | NON-BLOCKING — guarded by implementation |
| CAT-SCHEMA-003 | `currency` not rendered in detail page or cart items; no currency assumptions added | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |

No new CAT-SCHEMA IDs introduced. PW5-WL5 introduces no new gaps.

### D — Architectural Compliance Record

| Rule | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Single-fetch storefront | `WLStorefront` remains sole catalog fetch owner; `WLProductDetailPage` receives `addToCart` via prop — no service import, no direct API call from detail page |
| Tenant isolation (D-017-A) | `AddToCartRequest = { catalogItemId, quantity }` — no `tenantId`; server resolves tenant from JWT exclusively |
| CASE A reuse | `CartContext` / `cartService` / `Cart.tsx` / `App.tsx` `CartProvider` all unchanged; no new context, no new service |
| Schema stability | No Prisma/schema/migration/seed/RLS files in implementation commit |
| Backend stability | No backend files in implementation commit; cart route already exists (`POST /api/tenant/cart/items`) |
| Presentational purity | `WLProductDetailPage` imports only React + type from `catalogService` — no service client added |
| Build quality | `tsc --noEmit` clean; `eslint --max-warnings=0` clean; 2 WL-only files in commit |

### E — Doctrine Alignment Note

PW5-WL5 activates cart mutation from the WL storefront product detail surface using the pre-existing B2C cart infrastructure (CASE A). The unit belongs to the storefront-consumer-facing WL surface. No new cart routes, no new checkout logic, and no payment/fund-movement behavior is introduced in this unit. CartContext is consumed passively via `useCart()` prop delegation — the WL detail page never directly touches the cart service. Anti-bazaar, settlement, and AI-governance boundaries are unchanged.

### F — Audit-Safe Conclusion

PW5-WL5 successfully activates the WL storefront cart foundation via minimal, targeted changes to exactly two WL component files. The unit reuses the existing CartContext contract (CASE A), preserves the constitutional single-fetch storefront architecture, maintains D-017-A tenant isolation, and passes all seven verification gates. No tenant isolation, schema, backend, or governance boundaries were altered. **PW5-WL5 FULLY CLOSED. WL1–WL5 tranche complete. Next: PW5-WL6 (Product Images).**

*Updated: 2026-03-13 — PW5-WL5 cart/checkout foundation closure recorded (Section 9.24); PW5-WL5 FULLY CLOSED; WL1–WL5 all COMPLETE; CASE A CartContext reuse confirmed; no backend/schema/tenant-isolation changes · commit c40eb64 · verification PASS · next unit: PW5-WL6 (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL5-GOV)*

## Section 9.25 — PW5-WL6 Product Images

**Unit:** PW5-WL6  
**Name:** Product Images  
**Implementation commit:** e8f5d551ba220c880630b132bc00af07012fc042  
**Verification:** PW5-WL6-VERIFY — PASS — 2026-03-13  
**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL6-GOV — 2026-03-13

### A — Discovery Result

**CASE A — Existing safe image contract reused.**

`CatalogItem.imageUrl?: string` was already present in `services/catalogService.ts` (confirmed present since commit c40eb64 — pre-WL6 baseline). The field travels through the existing single catalog fetch in `WLStorefront` and arrives at `ProductCard` and `WLProductDetailPage` via props. No new fetching, no schema change, no backend widening, and no new service contract was required.

### B — Implementation Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `components/WL/ProductCard.tsx` | `useState` added; `imgError` local state; `h-40` image container with `<img loading="lazy" alt={item.name} onError>` when `imageUrl` present; SVG placeholder (`aria-hidden="true"`) when absent or broken |
| `components/WL/WLProductDetailPage.tsx` | `imgError` local state added; `h-64` primary image surface before existing header; `<img loading="eager" alt={item.name} onError>`; SVG placeholder at `h-16 w-16`; JSDoc updated |

All other WL, backend, schema, migration, seed, RLS, governance, and application files unchanged.

### C — Gap Status

| ID | Description | PW5-WL6 Status |
|---|---|---|
| CAT-SCHEMA-001 | `imageUrl` historical observation | NON-BLOCKING — `CatalogItem.imageUrl?: string` already present as optional field in frontend contract; WL6 rendering uses it as-is; DB-column presence irrelevant to this rendering unit; observation retained as historical record only |
| CAT-SCHEMA-002 | `moq?: number` optional | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |
| CAT-SCHEMA-003 | `currency` not rendered | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |

No new CAT-SCHEMA IDs introduced. PW5-WL6 introduces no new gaps.

### D — Architectural Compliance Record

| Rule | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Single-fetch storefront | `getCatalogItems` in `WLStorefront` only (lines 52+107); absent from `ProductCard`, `WLProductDetailPage`, `ProductGrid`; image rendering introduces no network activity |
| No duplicate requests | `onError` fires → `setImgError(true)` (local state); no fetch; no retry; no media side-channel |
| Tenant isolation (D-017-A) | No `tenantId` in functional code of any touched file; tenant context remains JWT/server-derived exclusively |
| Schema stability | No Prisma/schema/migration/seed/RLS files in implementation commit |
| Backend stability | No `server/` files in implementation commit; `CatalogItem.imageUrl` pre-existed in frontend type contract |
| Presentational purity | `ProductCard` and `WLProductDetailPage` remain data-fetching-free; image rendering is prop/state driven only |
| Build quality | `tsc --noEmit` clean; `eslint --max-warnings=0` clean; `git show --stat e8f5d55`: 2 files (79 insertions / 6 deletions) |

### E — Doctrine Alignment Note

PW5-WL6 activates product imagery in the WL storefront by reusing the pre-existing `CatalogItem.imageUrl` contract already available in the catalog data path. The unit adds image rendering to grid and detail surfaces with bounded local fallback handling for absent or broken images, without expanding backend or schema scope. The constitutional single-fetch storefront architecture remains intact, tenant identity stays exclusively server/JWT-derived, and verification passed across all gates.

No seller/admin/media-management boundary was widened. No finance/settlement/AI-governance/back-office doctrine was expanded. Image rendering belongs to the storefront experience layer. No new doctrine entries are introduced in this unit.

### F — Audit-Safe Conclusion

PW5-WL6 successfully activates WL product imagery via minimal, targeted changes to exactly two WL component files. The unit reuses the existing `CatalogItem.imageUrl` field (CASE A), preserves the constitutional single-fetch storefront architecture, maintains D-017-A tenant isolation, and passes all seven verification gates. No tenant isolation, schema, backend, or governance boundaries were altered. **PW5-WL6 FULLY CLOSED. WL1–WL6 tranche complete. Next: PW5-WL7 (Storefront Performance Optimizations).**

*Updated: 2026-03-13 — PW5-WL6 product images closure recorded (Section 9.25); PW5-WL6 FULLY CLOSED; WL1–WL6 all COMPLETE; CASE A CatalogItem.imageUrl reuse confirmed; no backend/schema/tenant-isolation changes · commit e8f5d55 · verification PASS · next unit: PW5-WL7 (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL6-GOV)*

## Section 9.26 — PW5-WL7 Storefront Performance Optimizations

**Unit:** PW5-WL7  
**Name:** Storefront Performance Optimizations  
**Implementation commit:** d860b6bda9c7ae9e0670c6641c265e314e202109  
**Verification:** PW5-WL7-VERIFY — PASS — 2026-03-13  
**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL7-GOV — 2026-03-13

### A — Discovery Result

Render-path performance opportunities were concentrated in memo boundaries and prop stability across the four WL child components. `WLStorefront` was already correctly optimized with stable `useCallback` handlers and a full `useMemo` derivation chain and was intentionally left unchanged.

| Component | Finding |
|---|---|
| `ProductCard` | Not memoized; `Intl.NumberFormat` reconstructed on every render |
| `ProductGrid` | Not memoized; created `() => onSelectItem(item.id)` inline closure per card per render |
| `WLSearchBar` | Not memoized; re-rendered on `activeCategory`/`selectedItemId` changes unrelated to search |
| `WLCollectionsPanel` | Not memoized; re-rendered on every `searchQuery` keystroke |
| `WLStorefront` | Already fully optimized — intentionally unchanged |

### B — Implementation Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `components/WL/ProductCard.tsx` | `React.memo` applied; `onSelect` type changed `() => void` → `(id: string) => void`; module-level `priceFormatter` singleton replaces per-render `Intl.NumberFormat` construction |
| `components/WL/ProductGrid.tsx` | `React.memo` applied; `() => onSelectItem(item.id)` per-card inline closure removed; `onSelect={onSelectItem}` direct stable-ref pass |
| `components/WL/WLSearchBar.tsx` | `React.memo` applied — skips re-render on `activeCategory`/`selectedItemId` state changes |
| `components/WL/WLCollectionsPanel.tsx` | `React.memo` applied — skips re-render on `searchQuery` keystrokes |

All other WL, backend, schema, migration, seed, RLS, governance, and application files unchanged.

### C — Rule → Evidence Mapping

| Rule | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Single-fetch storefront | `getCatalogItems` imported and called in `WLStorefront` only; absent from all 4 modified files; render optimization introduces no additional network activity |
| No duplicate requests | `onError` in `ProductCard` fires `setImgError(true)` — local state; no fetch; memo boundary does not change network behavior |
| Tenant isolation (D-017-A) | No `tenantId` in functional code of any touched file; tenant context remains JWT/server-derived; `WLStorefront` auth path unchanged |
| Schema stability | No Prisma/schema/migration/seed/RLS files in implementation commit |
| Backend stability | No `server/` files in implementation commit; no API contracts changed |
| Behavioral integrity | Category browsing, detail, search, cart, images, keyboard selection, back navigation all preserved; `handleSelectItem` still invoked correctly via `onSelect(item.id)` in `ProductCard` |
| Performance integrity | Memo boundaries are prop-stable: `handleSelectItem` is `useCallback([], [])` (stable); `categories` is `useMemo` ref (stable); `setSearchQuery`/`setActiveCategory` are stable React state setters; `activeCategory` and `value` are primitives; no stale-prop or stale-callback risk introduced |
| Build quality | `tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; `eslint --max-warnings 0` EXIT 0 on all 4 files; `git show --stat d860b6b`: 4 files (50 insertions / 24 deletions) |

### D — Gap Status

| ID | Description | PW5-WL7 Status |
|---|---|---|
| CAT-SCHEMA-001 | `category` absent from schema; fallback grouping valid | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |
| CAT-SCHEMA-002 | `moq?: number` optional; guarded in existing implementation | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged |
| CAT-SCHEMA-003 | `imageUrl` historical observation | NON-BLOCKING — unchanged; PW5-WL7 is optimization-only |

No new CAT-SCHEMA IDs introduced. PW5-WL7 introduces no new gaps.

### E — Doctrine Alignment Note

PW5-WL7 closes the WL storefront tranche with a bounded render-path optimization pass. The unit preserves the constitutional single-fetch storefront architecture, keeps all data ownership in `WLStorefront`, leaves tenant identity exclusively server/JWT-derived, and improves rendering efficiency without widening backend or schema scope. White-label storefront remains the consumer-facing rendering surface. No seller/admin/finance/settlement/AI-governance/back-office doctrine was expanded. No new doctrine entries are introduced in this unit.

### F — Audit-Safe Conclusion

PW5-WL7 successfully closes the WL storefront tranche with a focused render-path optimization pass on four WL child components. `React.memo` is applied with correct prop-stability guarantees. The per-card inline selection closure is eliminated. The `Intl.NumberFormat` singleton removes per-render object construction. `WLStorefront` is intentionally unchanged. All verification gates pass. No tenant isolation, schema, backend, or governance boundaries were altered. **PW5-WL7 FULLY CLOSED. WL1–WL7 tranche complete. WL storefront tranche closed — await next approved roadmap sequence.**

*Updated: 2026-03-13 — PW5-WL7 storefront performance optimizations closure recorded (Section 9.26); PW5-WL7 FULLY CLOSED; WL1–WL7 ALL COMPLETE; WL storefront tranche closed; no backend/schema/tenant-isolation changes · commit d860b6b · verification PASS · WL storefront tranche complete; await next approved sequence (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-WL7-GOV)*

| Gap ID | U-001 |
| Verification ID | VER-008 |
| Implementation unit | TECS-VER008-REMEDIATION |
| Implementation commit | `960b736` |
| Re-verification result | PASS |
| Gap decision | CLOSED |

### B — Defect Closure Summary

| Defect ID | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| DEF-VER008-001 | `GET /api/ai/health` was publicly exposed — returned provider name, model, and API key configuration state without authentication | CLOSED — `tenantAuthMiddleware` added to `onRequest` chain of `GET /health` in `server/src/routes/ai.ts` |
| DEF-VER008-002 | `/api/ai` absent from `ENDPOINT_REALM_MAP` — realm posture was fallback-derived via generic `/api/*` rule; not explicit or auditable | CLOSED — `'/api/ai': 'tenant'` added to `ENDPOINT_REALM_MAP` in `server/src/middleware/realmGuard.ts` |

### C — Rule → Evidence Mapping

| Rule | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Explicit realm declaration | `'/api/ai': 'tenant'` present in `ENDPOINT_REALM_MAP` at `server/src/middleware/realmGuard.ts` line 24; posture explicit and auditable |
| Health route protection | `fastify.get('/health', { onRequest: [tenantAuthMiddleware] }, ...)` confirmed in `server/src/routes/ai.ts`; no longer public |
| Protected AI route continuity | `GET /api/ai/insights` — `onRequest: [tenantAuthMiddleware, databaseContextMiddleware]` unchanged; `POST /api/ai/negotiation-advice` — same pattern unchanged |
| Schema stability | No Prisma schema, migration, seed, or RLS policy files in implementation commit |
| Backend integrity | Only `realmGuard.ts` and `ai.ts` changed; diff: 3 insertions, 2 deletions |
| Payload hygiene | `/api/ai/health` response shape unchanged; only auth gate added |
| Scope discipline | No new routes added; no AI feature logic changed; no unrelated middleware touched |

### D — Auth Posture Summary (Post-Remediation)

| Route | Method | Auth Posture | Realm |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/ai/health` | GET | `tenantAuthMiddleware` (added by commit 960b736) | `tenant` (explicit) |
| `/api/ai/insights` | GET | `tenantAuthMiddleware` + `databaseContextMiddleware` (unchanged) | `tenant` (explicit) |
| `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` | POST | `tenantAuthMiddleware` + `databaseContextMiddleware` (unchanged) | `tenant` (explicit) |

### E — Governance Narrative

U-001 is now fully closed. The prior AI route auth posture defects identified by VER-008 — public exposure of `/api/ai/health` and lack of explicit `/api/ai` realm declaration — were remediated by commit `960b736`. Re-verification confirms that all `/api/ai/*` routes are now tenant-auth protected and that realm posture is explicit and auditable. No schema, migration, or broader AI feature changes were introduced.

### F — Audit-Safe Conclusion

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Scope | PASS — only two allowlisted backend files changed |
| Auth posture | PASS — all `/api/ai/*` routes tenant-auth protected; `/api/ai` explicitly mapped |
| Runtime correctness | PASS — no route registration regressions; TypeScript EXIT 0 |
| Build quality | PASS — `tsc --noEmit` EXIT 0; lint 0 errors on touched files |
| Behavioral integrity | PASS — no unrelated AI route behavior changed; no new public exposure |
| Schema / data integrity | PASS — no Prisma/schema/migration/seed/RLS changes |
| Governance integrity | PASS — original VER-008 defects remediated and closed |

**Overall audit conclusion: COMPLIANT**

**U-001 / VER-008: CLOSED. Await next approved verification unit (VER-009 / U-002).**

*Updated: 2026-03-13 — U-001/VER-008 AI route auth posture remediation closure recorded (Section 9.27); TECS-VER008-REMEDIATION CLOSED; implementation commit 960b736; re-verification PASS; GOVERNANCE-SYNC-U-001 complete; await VER-009*

| Gap ID | U-002 |
| Verification ID | VER-009 |
| Files inspected | `server/src/routes/admin/tenantProvision.ts` · `server/src/middleware/auth.ts` |
| Verification result | PASS |
| Gap decision | CLOSED |

### B — Auth Posture Summary (Verified)

| Layer | Mechanism | Location | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Realm guard | `ENDPOINT_REALM_MAP: '/api/control' → 'admin'` | `realmGuard.ts` | Wrong-realm tokens rejected 403 before plugin entry |
| 2 — Plugin authentication | `fastify.addHook('onRequest', adminAuthMiddleware)` | `tenantProvision.ts` line 67 | Admin JWT verified; `isAdmin`, `adminId`, `adminRole` set; 401 on failure |
| 3 — Role authorization | `preHandler: requireAdminRole('SUPER_ADMIN')` | `tenantProvision.ts` line 85 | Explicit SUPER_ADMIN role enforced; 403 if role absent or mismatched |
| 4 — Inline fail-fast | `if (!request.isAdmin \|\| !request.adminId) return 403` | `tenantProvision.ts` lines 92–96 | Defense-in-depth before any service invocation |

### C — Rule → Evidence Mapping

| Rule | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Explicit SUPER_ADMIN enforcement | `requireAdminRole('SUPER_ADMIN')` declared as `preHandler` on route; `requireAdminRole` in `auth.ts` rejects 403 if `adminRole` not in `allowedRoles` |
| Plugin authentication | `fastify.addHook('onRequest', adminAuthMiddleware)` — applies to all routes in plugin; `adminAuthMiddleware` calls `request.adminJwtVerify()` and sets `isAdmin`/`adminId`/`adminRole` |
| Realm integrity | `/api/control` in `ENDPOINT_REALM_MAP` maps to `admin`; enforced by `realmGuard.ts` |
| Defense in depth | Inline `if (!request.isAdmin \|\| !request.adminId)` guard fires before `provisionTenant()` is called |
| Export safety | Only export is `export default tenantProvisionRoutes` (Fastify plugin); no standalone callable functions exported |
| Prior uncertainty resolved | Previous inspection was 150 lines only; full 187-line read + direct dependency inspection (`auth.ts`) confirms posture completely |

### D — Governance Narrative

U-002 is now fully closed. The prior uncertainty around `admin/tenantProvision.ts` auth posture was caused by partial inspection only. Full verification confirms that tenant provisioning is protected by explicit SUPER_ADMIN enforcement at the route level via `requireAdminRole('SUPER_ADMIN')`, backed by plugin-level admin JWT authentication, admin realm binding via `realmGuard.ts`, and an inline fail-fast admin-context check before any service invocation. No bypass surface exists and no implementation changes were required.

### E — Audit-Safe Conclusion

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Read completeness | PASS — full 187-line file read + `auth.ts` dependency inspected |
| Auth posture clarity | PASS — four independent enforcement layers confirmed; SUPER_ADMIN explicit |
| Evidence quality | PASS — all findings grounded in actual code; no CI assumption relied upon |
| Governance usefulness | PASS — gap closed with clear evidence; no follow-up required |

**Overall audit conclusion: COMPLIANT**

**U-002 / VER-009: CLOSED. Await next approved verification unit (VER-010 / U-004).**

*Updated: 2026-03-13 — U-002/VER-009 `admin/tenantProvision.ts` auth guard closure recorded (Section 9.28); PASS; GOVERNANCE-SYNC-U-002 complete; await VER-010*

| 1 — UI admission | `WL_ADMIN_ROLES = {OWNER, ADMIN, TENANT_OWNER, TENANT_ADMIN}`; `appState = 'WL_ADMIN'` only if role matches | `App.tsx` lines 294, 316, 327, 339 | Non-admitted users never reach the panel |
| 2 — Component design | No local role variable/prop/context; upstream gate relied upon intentionally | `WLOrdersPanel.tsx` header + table comment | Actions visible to all admitted WL_ADMIN users by design |
| 3 — Backend enforcement | `if (!['OWNER', 'ADMIN'].includes(userRole ?? '')) return 403` | `tenant.ts` line 1046–1048 | Independent role gate; enforces final barrier regardless of UI |

### C — Rule → Evidence Mapping

| Rule | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Upstream routing gate | `App.tsx` sets `appState = 'WL_ADMIN'` only when `is_white_label === true && WL_ADMIN_ROLES.has(me.role)` (lines 316, 327, 339) |
| Intentional component design | `WLOrdersPanel.tsx` header (lines 16–19): “All users in WL_ADMIN appState are already OWNER/ADMIN — the routing gate enforces WL_ADMIN_ROLES before setting appState = ‘WL_ADMIN’. No separate role state variable is needed here.” |
| Backend authorization | `PATCH /api/tenant/orders/:id/status` at `tenant.ts` line 1046: explicitly rejects non-OWNER/ADMIN with 403 FORBIDDEN |
| No bypass | UI + backend combined posture: unauthorized users cannot enter `WL_ADMIN`, and even if they did, the backend PATCH would reject the transition |

### D — Non-Blocking Governance Notation

`WL_ADMIN_ROLES` in `App.tsx` includes `TENANT_OWNER` and `TENANT_ADMIN` alongside `OWNER` and `ADMIN`. The backend PATCH route enforces only `OWNER` and `ADMIN`. If any user holds a legacy `TENANT_OWNER` or `TENANT_ADMIN` role string and reaches `WL_ADMIN`, action buttons would be visible but the backend PATCH would return 403. This is recorded as a **non-blocking governance notation only** — it is not an open gap, does not constitute a data or authorization breach, and does not require an implementation unit at this time.

### E — Governance Narrative

U-004 is now fully closed. The prior uncertainty around `WLOrdersPanel.tsx` role-gating was caused by incomplete inspection of the action area (only first 200 lines previously read). Full verification confirms that the component intentionally relies on upstream App-level `WL_ADMIN` admission control, while the backend status-transition PATCH route independently enforces authorized roles. No unauthorized order-state transition bypass exists. The minor legacy-role naming mismatch (`TENANT_OWNER`/`TENANT_ADMIN` in `WL_ADMIN_ROLES` vs. `OWNER`/`ADMIN` in PATCH gate) is recorded as non-blocking governance notation only.

### F — Audit-Safe Conclusion

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Read completeness | PASS — full 480-line `WLOrdersPanel.tsx` read + `App.tsx` routing gate + backend PATCH route inspected |
| Auth posture clarity | PASS — upstream routing gate confirmed real; backend independently enforces role; no bypass path |
| Evidence quality | PASS — findings grounded in actual code from three files; no assumption |
| Governance usefulness | PASS — gap closed with clear evidence; legacy-role note recorded non-blocking |

**Overall audit conclusion: COMPLIANT**

**U-004 / VER-010: CLOSED. Wave 0 verification pass (VER-001 through VER-010) is now complete — all items resolved (PASS / FAIL / IMPLEMENTED / CLOSED). Wave 1 gate was already closed (GOVERNANCE-SYNC-106). Await next approved roadmap sequence.**

## Section 9.30 — PW5-AI-PLAN Wave 5 AI/Event Backbone Re-Baseline — 2026-03-13

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-PLAN | **Type:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC — Planning Baseline Recording | **Date:** 2026-03-13  
**Execution type:** Planning Prompt — Read-Only  
**Files modified in this governance sync:** `docs/governance/IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER-2026-03.md` · `governance/gap-register.md` · `docs/governance/audits/2026-03-audit-reconciliation-matrix.md`  
**(no product code; no schema/migration/RLS/routes/UI/services/infrastructure files changed)**

### A — Unit Outcome

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Classification | PLANNING COMPLETE / BASELINE ESTABLISHED |
| Execution mode | Read-only; no code, no schema, no routes, no governance-independent implementation |
| Position in sequence | Follows PW5-WL tranche (WL1–WL7 closed) and PW5-CP-PLAN baseline |
| TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE | **NOT CLOSED** — backend design gate preserved |
| G-028 B/C wave status | Not started; requires separate design/execution authorization |

### B — Baseline Findings Summary

#### Tenant-Plane AI Inference Surface

| Item | Finding |
|---|---|
| Routes confirmed | `GET /api/ai/insights` · `POST /api/ai/negotiation-advice` · `GET /api/ai/health` |
| Implementation file | `server/src/routes/ai.ts` (460 lines; monolithic — all orchestration in route handlers) |
| Auth posture | All three routes tenant-auth protected (commit 960b736 resolves prior VER-008 defects) |
| Budget enforcement | `aiBudget.ts` active on both inference routes; `BudgetExceededError` → HTTP 429 |
| RAG | `ragContextBuilder.ts` (G-028 A5) wired into `insights` only; constants: TOP_K=5, MIN_SIM=0.30, MAX_CHUNKS=3 |
| Reasoning audit | G-023 `reasoning_logs` table; SHA-256 hash; atomic write with `audit_logs` in same Prisma transaction |
| Vector pipeline | `vectorIngestion.ts` + `vectorIndexQueue.ts` + `vectorChunker.ts` + `vectorStore.ts` (pgvector, dim=768) — G-028 A4/A6 complete |
| Frontend path | `services/aiService.ts` (governance-compliant); `services/geminiService.ts` deprecated (throws on call) |

#### Event Backbone

| Item | Finding |
|---|---|
| Backbone status | Operational for tenancy/team/marketplace domains |
| `KnownEventName` entries | 9 entries — zero AI domain entries present |
| `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` | No AI audit actions mapped |
| Projection infrastructure | `projector.ts` engine complete; `registry.ts` functional; only `marketplace.projector.ts` handler registered |
| AI event emission | No `ai.inference.*` or `ai.vector.*` events emitted anywhere in codebase |
| G-028 AI event design | 11 AI event types designed in G-028 spec; none implemented in registry or emission map |

#### Control-Plane AI Governance

| Item | Finding |
|---|---|
| `AiGovernance.tsx` data source | Derives from `GET /api/control/tenants`; no dedicated AI backend route |
| Authority buttons | Gated/hidden — PW5-U3 (commit d5ee430, 2026-03-09) |
| `/api/control/ai/*` routes | None exist |
| TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE | REMAINS OPEN / `REQUIRES_BACKEND_DESIGN` |
| G-028 C-wave | Not started; cannot begin without authorized design unit |

### C — Drift Observations (D-001 through D-009)

| ID | File/Location | Finding | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | **MATERIALLY REDUCED / RESOLVED BY PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT** — orchestration extracted into `server/src/services/ai/inferenceService.ts`; route layer no longer primary home of AI orchestration logic | Closed |
| D-002 | `server/src/lib/events.ts` (`KnownEventName` · `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME`) | AI domain events entirely absent; prerequisite for downstream AI event consumers | High |
| D-003 | `server/src/lib/vectorShadowQuery.ts` ~line 70 | `TODO(G028-A4): replace with real embedding pipeline` — placeholder; shadow results near-zero similarity | Low |
| D-004 | `server/src/services/ai/inferenceService.ts` + `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | ~~No per-tenant per-minute rate limiting (G-028 §6.3 specifies 60 req/min)~~ — CLOSED via PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT + PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION: limiter enforced at TIS boundary (60 / 60_000ms), rate-limit rejection separated from budget semantics | Closed |
| D-005 | `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | PII redaction pipeline (pre-send + post-receive) not implemented | Medium |
| D-006 | `server/src/services/ai/inferenceService.ts` + `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | ~~`idempotency_key` column absent in `reasoning_logs`~~ — CLOSED via PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY + PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION: request-level idempotency enforced at TIS boundary using `request_id = idem:<key>`, tenant-scoped 24-hour replay lookup, preserved replay semantics, and restored rate-limit ordering (rate limit before replay return) | Closed |
| D-007 | `components/ControlPlane/AiGovernance.tsx` | Control-plane AI governance UI cosmetic; no dedicated AI backend; acknowledged design gate | Acknowledged |
| D-008 | `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | Auth-plane ambiguity for `GET /api/ai/health` resolved by commit 960b736; notation retained | Low |
| D-009 | `server/src/services/ai/inferenceService.ts` | ~~`negotiation-advice` has no RAG injection; diverges from `insights` without documented rationale~~ — CLOSED via PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG (commit de202c2): negotiation-advice now calls governed `runRagRetrieval(tx, orgId, prompt)`; retrieved context injected into actual model prompt using same prepend pattern as insights; TIS ordering preserved; insights path unchanged | Closed |

### D — Gap Disposition

| ID | Description | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE | AI Governance Dead Authority Actions | NOT CLOSED — backend design gate preserved; no change in this unit |
| AI_GOV-BACKEND-001 | AiGovernance.tsx derives from tenants endpoint; no dedicated AI route | OPEN — design gate; unchanged by this baseline |
| D-002 | AI domain events absent from KnownEventName | **CLOSED** — PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN (registry, commit dd18957 · 2026-03-13) + PW5-AI-EMITTER (emission runtime wiring, commit 73f0972 · 2026-03-13) both implemented and verified; `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` not mapped by design — emission wiring does not require audit action mapping; emission gap is now CLOSED for current trigger coverage |
| D-001 | TIS monolith concentration in route layer | **CLOSED / MATERIALLY REDUCED** — PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT implemented and verified (commit f2ae23b · 2026-03-13) |
| D-005 | PII redaction pipeline absent | OPEN — remains out-of-scope for PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT; requires separate authorized unit |
| D-004 | No per-tenant rate limiting | **CLOSED** — PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT implemented (96ca710) and corrected via PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION (4b96e13); rate-limit path no longer emits `ai.inference.budget_exceeded`; 429 + `AI_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` preserved |
| D-006 | AI idempotency retry dedupe and replay semantics | **CLOSED** — PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY implemented (84c185d) and corrected via PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION (536fe50); replay remains deduplicated by tenant + key with 24-hour lookup and no replay-side inference/writes/events; rate-limit semantics restored by enforcing limiter before replay return |
| D-009 | negotiation-advice has no RAG | **CLOSED** — PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG implemented (de202c2); negotiation-advice now calls governed `runRagRetrieval()`; retrieved context augments model prompt; insights path unchanged; TIS ordering preserved; no schema/event/route changes |
| D-003, D-008 | Shadow query placeholder; health auth note | LOW — recorded; low urgency |

### E — Follow-On Units (Proposed; Not Authorized Unless Noted)

| Status | Unit ID | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ CLOSED (dd18957 · 2026-03-13) | PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN | Register AI domain events; prerequisite for all downstream AI event consumers; resolves D-002 |

**Overall audit conclusion: PLANNING COMPLETE / BASELINE ESTABLISHED**

**PW5-AI-PLAN: CLOSED as planning baseline. Wave 5 AI/event architecture baseline is now recorded in governance. TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE remains open. PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN ✅ CLOSED (dd18957 · 2026-03-13). PW5-AI-EMITTER ✅ CLOSED (73f0972 · 2026-03-13). PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT ✅ CLOSED / VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE (f2ae23b · 2026-03-13).

## PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-NEGOTIATION-RAG | **Date:** 2026-03-14 | **Type:** Implementation + Verification Closure

**Classification:** IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE · VERIFIED (VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE)

**Implementation commit:** de202c2 — `feat(ai): add RAG retrieval to negotiation advice`

**Retrieval integration confirmed:**

- Negotiation-advice path now calls `runRagRetrieval(tx, orgId, prompt)` — the same governed function imported from `./ragContextBuilder.js` already used by insights. No duplication; no alternative path.
- Retrieval occurs before model invocation (step 4 in TIS; model call is step 5).
- Fail-safe contract preserved: `runRagRetrieval` returns `{ contextBlock: null, meta: null }` on flag-off or error; negotiation falls back to original prompt; inference never blocked.
- `ai.vector.query` event originates from retrieval layer (`ragContextBuilder.ts`) — not reimplemented in TIS.

**Prompt augmentation confirmed:**

- `finalPrompt` is the actual input to `generateContent()`: context block prepended to base prompt when retrieval returns results; falls back to original prompt otherwise.
- Augmentation pattern is identical to the insights path.
- Character cap enforced inside `buildRagContextBlock` (`MAX_INJECTED_CHARS = 3_000`).
- `reasoningHash` and `promptSummary` now derived from `finalPrompt` — stored fingerprint reflects actual content sent to model.

**Insights path unchanged:** The `if (taskType === 'insights')` branch is structurally identical to its pre-implementation state.

**No defects remain.**

**Verification note (non-defect):** static code-path verification performed; no live runtime probe introduced in read-only verification unit. Consistent with verification convention for PW5-AI-EMITTER, PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT, PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION, and PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION.

**Evidence chain:**

- Implementation commit: `de202c2` — `feat(ai): add RAG retrieval to negotiation advice`.
- Typecheck: EXIT 0. Lint: EXIT 0 (0 errors, 108 pre-existing warnings). Build: EXIT 0.
- Scope gate: 1 file changed (`server/src/services/ai/inferenceService.ts`), 28 insertions / 10 deletions.
- D-009 resolved.

## PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-IDEMPOTENCY-REMEDIATION | **Date:** 2026-03-14 | **Type:** Remediation + Verification Closure

**Classification:** IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE · VERIFIED (VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE)

**Defect corrected:** initial idempotency replay returned before tenant rate-limit enforcement, creating semantic drift against authoritative PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT behavior.

**Corrected state recorded:**

- TIS ordering now enforces tenant rate limit before replay lookup/return.
- Replay still returns stored logical result.
- Replay still skips model invocation, new reasoning-log creation, new audit-log creation, and inference event re-emission.
- 24-hour replay logic remains present.
- First-execution transaction/event semantics remain unchanged.
- Route/header contract for `Idempotency-Key` remains unchanged.
- No schema changes, no event schema changes, no new event names, no emitter definition changes, no route-path changes, and no rate-limit value changes (60 / 60_000 ms).

**Evidence chain:**

- Initial implementation commit: `84c185d` — `feat(ai): implement idempotency support for AI inference`.
- Remediation commit: `536fe50` — `fix(ai): apply rate limiting before idempotent replay`.
- Verification result: `VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE`.

**Verification note (non-defect):** static code-path verification performed; no live runtime probe introduced in read-only verification unit.

---

## PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT-REMEDIATION | **Date:** 2026-03-14 | **Type:** Remediation + Verification Closure

**Classification:** IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE · VERIFIED (VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE)

**Defect corrected:** rate-limit rejection previously flowed through budget-exceeded handling and emitted `ai.inference.budget_exceeded`.

**Corrected state recorded:**

- Rate-limit path now distinct from budget path.
- Rate-limited requests return HTTP 429 with `error: "AI_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"`.
- Rate-limited requests no longer emit `ai.inference.generate`, `ai.inference.error`, or `ai.inference.budget_exceeded`.
- True budget exhaustion behavior preserved for real `BudgetExceededError`.
- No schema changes, no event schema changes, no new event names, no emitter definition changes, no route-path changes, no rate-limit value changes.

**Evidence chain:**

- Initial implementation commit: `96ca710` — `feat(ai): implement per-tenant AI rate limiting`.
- Remediation commit: `4b96e13` — `fix(ai): separate rate-limit rejection from budget-exceeded emission`.
- Verification result: `VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE`.

**Verification note (non-defect):** static code-path verification performed; no live runtime probe introduced in read-only verification unit.

## PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN — AI Event Domain Registration — IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED

**Governance sync:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN | **Date:** 2026-03-13 | **Type:** Implementation + Verification Closure

**Verification result:** VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE

**Commit:** dd18957 — `feat(events): register AI event domain (inference + vector)`

### A — Unit Scope and Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Unit type | TECS Implementation |
| Execution unit | PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN |
| Predecessor | PW5-AI-PLAN (planning baseline, 2026-03-13) |
| Status | IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE |
| Verification | VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE |
| Commit | dd18957 |

### B — What Was Implemented

| File | Change Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `server/src/lib/events.ts` | MODIFIED | `KnownEventName` union extended with 9 AI event names; `knownEventEnvelopeSchema` Zod enum extended with same 9 names (exact string alignment confirmed) |
| `server/src/events/eventSchemas.ts` | CREATED | 9 Zod payload schemas; `EVENT_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS: Partial<Record<KnownEventName, z.ZodTypeAny>>`; `validateEventPayload()` helper; all schemas use `.passthrough()` for forward compatibility |

**AI event names registered (9 total):**

| Domain | Event Name |
|---|---|
| AI Inference | `ai.inference.generate` |
| AI Inference | `ai.inference.error` |
| AI Inference | `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` |
| AI Inference | `ai.inference.pii_redacted` |
| AI Inference | `ai.inference.pii_leak_detected` |
| AI Inference | `ai.inference.cache_hit` |
| AI Vector | `ai.vector.upsert` |
| AI Vector | `ai.vector.delete` |
| AI Vector | `ai.vector.query` |

### C — Scope Discipline (Verified)

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` | NOT MODIFIED — intentional; emission wiring is PW5-AI-EMITTER |
| AI event emitters | NOT ADDED |
| Projection handlers | NOT ADDED |
| Routes | NOT MODIFIED |
| RLS policies | NOT MODIFIED |
| Prisma schema / migrations | NOT MODIFIED |
| `ai.ts` | NOT TOUCHED |
| Frontend code | NOT TOUCHED |
| `validateEventPayload()` wired into runtime | NOT DONE — intentional; not a defect |

### D — Integration Safety

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Existing `tenant.*` / `team.*` / `marketplace.cart.*` events preserved | ✅ PASS — all prior names unchanged in `KnownEventName` and `knownEventEnvelopeSchema` |
| `KnownEventName` ↔ `knownEventEnvelopeSchema` alignment | ✅ PASS — all 9 AI names present in both; exact string match confirmed |
| `validateEventPayload()` safe for non-AI events | ✅ PASS — `if (!schema) return payload;` passthrough; no behavioral impact on existing events |
| No unauthorized behavioral change in emission path | ✅ PASS — `maybeEmitEventFromAuditEntry()` unchanged; `validateEventPayload()` has no callers |
| EventEnvelope compatibility | ✅ PASS — AI event names pass `knownEventEnvelopeSchema.parse()` (Zod enum includes all 9); payload validated by `z.record(z.any())` in envelope schema |

### E — Validation Gates

| Gate | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Type check | `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) | ✅ PASS — zero output (zero errors) |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` | ✅ PASS — 0 errors; 108 warnings all pre-existing; no warnings in changed files |
| Build | `pnpm build` (`tsc`) | ✅ PASS — zero output (zero errors) |

### F — Defects

None.

### G — Follow-On Note (Preserved)

`validateEventPayload()` is defined in `server/src/events/eventSchemas.ts` and is not currently imported or called anywhere in the runtime. This is intentional per the unit boundary established in PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN. The function is infrastructure-ready but not yet active.

AI event emission remains a separate TECS unit: **PW5-AI-EMITTER**.

Downstream AI event projections and consumers remain future work until emission exists.

### H — Gap Register Delta

| Gap / Drift ID | Prior Status | New Status |
|---|---|---|
| D-002 (AI domain events absent from KnownEventName) | OPEN | ✅ CLOSED (registry layer) — emitter path open as PW5-AI-EMITTER |

### I — Audit-Safe Conclusion

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Unit scope | PASS — exactly 2 files changed; both within authorized event-system boundary |
| Registry correctness | PASS — all 9 AI event names in `KnownEventName` union and `knownEventEnvelopeSchema` Zod enum; exact string alignment |
| Payload schema coverage | PASS — all 9 AI events have Zod schemas; all registered in `EVENT_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS` |
| Scope discipline | PASS — no emitters, projections, routes, RLS, schema migrations, or audit mappings changed |
| Integration safety | PASS — existing tenant/team/marketplace events unaffected; emission path unchanged |
| No unauthorized widening | PASS — no behavioral change introduced into runtime |
| Follow-on note classified correctly | PASS — `validateEventPayload()` unconnected; correctly classified as follow-on (not defect) |
| Doctrine alignment | PASS — org_id/RLS posture unchanged; no routes added; no tenant isolation weakened |

**Overall audit conclusion: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED**

**PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN: CLOSED. AI event domain is now registry-ready. D-002 CLOSED (registry layer). Emitter wiring implemented in PW5-AI-EMITTER (commit 73f0972 · 2026-03-13). Next proposed unit: PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT.**

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-EMITTER | **Type:** IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED | **Date:** 2026-03-13

**Verification result:** VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE

**Commit:** 73f0972 — `feat(events): wire AI event emission runtime path`

### A — Unit Scope and Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Unit type | TECS Implementation |
| Execution unit | PW5-AI-EMITTER |
| Predecessor | PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN (registry layer, commit dd18957 · 2026-03-13) |
| Status | IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE |
| Verification | VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE |
| Commit | 73f0972 |

### B — What Was Implemented

| File | Change Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `server/src/events/aiEmitter.ts` | CREATED | `emitAiEventBestEffort()` async helper; `AiEventOpts` interface; full validated emission chain; best-effort (never rethrows) |
| `server/src/routes/ai.ts` | MODIFIED | Import added; `generateContent()` return type extended with `hadInferenceError: boolean`; `auditLog.id` captured from committed tx; 6 `void emitAiEventBestEffort(...)` call sites wired (2 success + 2 error + 2 budget per route) |
| `server/src/services/ai/ragContextBuilder.ts` | MODIFIED | Import added; `ai.vector.query` emitted after `querySimilar()` returns, before catch block |

### C — Trigger Points Wired

| Trigger Point | Event Name | Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/ai/insights` success path | `ai.inference.generate` | ✅ persists to `EventLog` (via captured `auditLog.id`) |
| `/api/ai/insights` inference failure (`hadInferenceError: true`) | `ai.inference.error` | sink-only |
| `/api/ai/insights` `BudgetExceededError` catch | `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` | sink-only |
| `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` success path | `ai.inference.generate` | ✅ persists to `EventLog` (via captured `negAuditLog.id`) |
| `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` inference failure | `ai.inference.error` | sink-only |
| `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` `BudgetExceededError` catch | `ai.inference.budget_exceeded` | sink-only |
| `runRagRetrieval()` inside `ragContextBuilder.ts` | `ai.vector.query` | sink-only |

### D — Emission Chain (Verified)

Runtime path implemented in `emitAiEventBestEffort()`:
1. `validateEventPayload(name, payload)` — Zod validation via `EVENT_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS`
2. Build `EventEnvelope` — `{ id: randomUUID(), version: 'v1', name, entity: { type: 'ai', id: orgId }, realm: 'TENANT', actor: 'SYSTEM', ... }`
3. `validateKnownEvent(envelope)` — validates name is in `KnownEventName`
4. `assertNoSecretsInPayload(knownEnvelope.payload)` — secrets guard
5. `emitEventToSink(knownEnvelope)` — in-memory sink emission
6. `storeEventBestEffort(prisma, knownEnvelope, auditLogId)` — conditional on `auditLogId && prisma`

### E — Persistence Boundary (Recorded)

`EventLog.auditLogId` is `NOT NULL @unique` with FK to `AuditLog`. Persistence is gated on `opts.auditLogId && opts.prisma`. Only success-path inference events (which capture a real `AuditLog.id` from a committed transaction) can persist to `EventLog`. All error-path, budget-path, and vector-query events are sink-only. This is an implementation constraint of the existing `EventLog` schema, not a regression introduced by PW5-AI-EMITTER.

### F — Scope Discipline (Verified)

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` | NOT MODIFIED — intentional; audit action mapping is separate from runtime emission wiring |
| AI event projections / consumers | NOT ADDED |
| New routes | NOT ADDED |
| Prisma schema / migrations | NOT MODIFIED |
| RLS policies | NOT MODIFIED |
| Control-plane AI governance | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| `ai.vector.upsert` / `ai.vector.delete` | NOT WIRED — async queue path (`vectorIndexQueue.ts`); no synchronous trigger available |
| PII events / cache_hit | NOT WIRED — no active runtime implementations for PII detection/redaction or inference caching |

### G — Deferred Items

| Event Name | Deferral Reason |
|---|---|
| `ai.vector.upsert` | In-process async queue (`vectorIndexQueue.ts`); max queue size 1,000; jobs lost on restart; no synchronous trigger in current call graph |
| `ai.vector.delete` | Same async queue path as upsert |
| `ai.inference.pii_redacted` | No PII redaction pipeline exists in codebase |
| `ai.inference.pii_leak_detected` | No PII detection pipeline exists in codebase |
| `ai.inference.cache_hit` | No inference caching implementation exists in codebase |

### H — Follow-On Note (Preserved)

When `genAI` is null (Gemini SDK not configured), `generateContent()` returns a degraded text response with `hadInferenceError: false`. This means the degraded-mode fallback emits `ai.inference.generate` rather than `ai.inference.error`. This is pre-existing upstream behavior in `ai.ts` and was not introduced by PW5-AI-EMITTER. This note does not classify PW5-AI-EMITTER as failed or defective. Correcting this behavior requires a separate scoped unit (likely within PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT where AI orchestration is extracted into a proper service boundary).

### I — Gap Register Delta

| Gap / Drift ID | Prior Status | New Status |
|---|---|---|
| D-002 (AI domain events absent from KnownEventName) | CLOSED (registry layer — PW5-AI-EVENT-DOMAIN) | ✅ FULLY CLOSED — emission layer also closed (PW5-AI-EMITTER) |
| AI emission gap (runtime wiring absent) | OPEN | ✅ CLOSED — for current approved trigger coverage |
| `ai.vector.upsert` / `ai.vector.delete` | OPEN | OPEN — intentionally deferred (no sync trigger) |
| PII events / `ai.inference.cache_hit` | OPEN | OPEN — intentionally deferred (no runtime implementations) |

### J — Validation Gates

| Gate | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Type check | `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) | ✅ PASS — zero errors |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` | ✅ PASS — 0 errors; 108 pre-existing warnings; no warnings in changed files |
| Build | `pnpm build` (`tsc`) | ✅ PASS — zero errors |

### K — Defects

None.

### L — Explicit Non-Actions Confirmed

- ❌ No `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` modification
- ❌ No AI projections added
- ❌ No new routes
- ❌ No Prisma schema changes
- ❌ No RLS changes
- ❌ No `ai.vector.upsert` wiring
- ❌ No `ai.vector.delete` wiring
- ❌ No `ai.inference.pii_redacted` / `pii_leak_detected` / `cache_hit` wiring
- ❌ No control-plane AI governance widening
- ❌ TECS-FBW-AIGOVERNANCE NOT closed

### M — Audit-Safe Conclusion

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Unit scope | PASS — 3 files changed; all within authorized AI/event boundary |
| Emission chain correctness | PASS — all 5 steps (`validateEventPayload` → `validateKnownEvent` → `assertNoSecretsInPayload` → `emitEventToSink` → `storeEventBestEffort`) wired in correct order |
| Trigger coverage | PASS — all 7 approved current trigger points wired; none missed within authorized scope |
| Persistence gating | PASS — `storeEventBestEffort` only called when `auditLogId && prisma`; compatible with `EventLog.auditLogId NOT NULL @unique` constraint |
| Scope discipline | PASS — `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` unchanged; no projections/routes/schema/RLS changes |
| Deferred items | PASS — all deferred items have documented rationale; no missing trigger claim |
| Follow-on note classified correctly | PASS — degraded-mode semantics correctly classified as pre-existing behavior, not defect |
| Integration safety | PASS — best-effort emission cannot disrupt inference route responses |
| Doctrine alignment | PASS — org_id/RLS posture unchanged; no routes added; no tenant isolation weakened |

**Overall audit conclusion: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED**

**PW5-AI-EMITTER: CLOSED. Runtime AI event emission is now operational for current approved trigger coverage. Deferred AI event types (`ai.vector.upsert` · `ai.vector.delete` · PII events · `ai.inference.cache_hit`) remain explicitly open. `AUDIT_ACTION_TO_EVENT_NAME` unchanged by design. No defects. One follow-on note preserved (degraded-mode semantics). Next proposed unit: PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT.**

## Section 9.32 — PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT — Tenant Inference Service Extraction Closure — 2026-03-14

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT | **Type:** IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED | **Date:** 2026-03-14

**Verification result:** VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE

**Commit:** f2ae23b — `refactor(ai): extract tenant inference service (TIS)`

### A — Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Unit type | TECS Implementation + Verification Closure Recording |
| Execution unit | PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT |
| Scope class | Structural extraction only (no behavior change) |
| Status | IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE |
| Verification | VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE |

### B — What Was Closed

| Item | Closure Evidence |
|---|---|
| Extraction reality | Orchestration moved from `server/src/routes/ai.ts` into `server/src/services/ai/inferenceService.ts` (real extraction, not cosmetic) |
| Route-layer narrowing | `ai.ts` now primarily handles auth/context checks, request validation/parsing, service invocation, and HTTP response formatting |
| Behavior preservation | Endpoint paths unchanged: `/api/ai/insights` · `/api/ai/negotiation-advice` · `/api/ai/health`; degraded-mode semantics unchanged |
| Transaction semantics | Reasoning-log and audit-log writes remain in existing transaction boundary (atomicity preserved) |
| Event behavior | Existing emitter path preserved (`ai.inference.generate` · `ai.inference.error` · `ai.inference.budget_exceeded`); `ai.vector.query` remains in RAG retrieval path |

### C — Explicit Non-Actions (Verified)

- No new routes
- No request/response contract changes
- No event names or payload schema changes
- No emitter semantic changes
- No PII handling, rate limiting, idempotency, or caching additions
- No Prisma schema changes
- No RLS changes

### D — Validation Record

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Typecheck | PASS |
| Lint | PASS (no new errors) |
| Build | PASS |
| Runtime verification | Not completed in verification unit (read-only mode); recorded as pending operational runbook execution |

### E — Defects

None.

### F — Governance Decision

PW5-AI-TIS-EXTRACT is **closed**. Verification state is recorded as **VERIFIED_COMPLETE_WITH_FOLLOW_ON_NOTE**. Runtime verification follow-on remains pending operational runbook execution and is explicitly classified as **non-defect**.

### G — Next Proposed Unit

**PW5-AI-RATE-LIMIT** — implement per-tenant AI request-frequency protection using the TIS boundary as the stable enforcement point.

### H — Audit-Safe Conclusion

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE / VERIFIED.**

Extraction boundary is materially improved (D-001 reduced), route/event/transaction behavior is preserved, and no unauthorized widening occurred.

## Section 9.33 — PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-ROUTE-REGISTRATION-VERIFICATION — Identifier-Less Tenant Login Closure — 2026-03-14

**Unit:** GOVERNANCE-SYNC-PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-ROUTE-REGISTRATION-VERIFICATION | **Type:** VERIFICATION + GOVERNANCE CLOSURE | **Date:** 2026-03-14

**Verification result:** VERIFIED CLOSED

**Remediation commit:** be151c7 — `fix(api): register public routes in vercel entrypoint`

### A — Classification

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Remediation chain | PW5-AUTH-ORG-IDENTIFIER-LESS-LOGIN |
| Root cause | publicRoutes absent from api/index.ts (Vercel serverless entrypoint); registered in server/src/index.ts (local/dev) only |
| Scope class | Route registration parity fix + RLS service role remediation + production verification |
| Status | VERIFIED CLOSED |

### B — Gap D-009 Closure

**D-009 — Tenant-by-email login failure under FORCE RLS**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Root cause layer 1 | FORCE RLS on public.memberships + public.users denied bare postgres reads; by-email query returned 0 rows for all emails |
| Root cause layer 2 | publicRoutes not registered in api/index.ts; production returned 404 for GET /api/public/tenants/by-email |
| Resolution | PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-RLS-REMEDIATION (texqtic_service SELECT grants) + PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-RLS-MIGRATION-COMPLIANCE (migration applied) + PW5-AUTH-BY-EMAIL-ROUTE-REGISTRATION-REMEDIATION (entrypoint parity) |
| Status | **VERIFIED CLOSED** |

### C — Production Evidence (Step A Verification)

| Test Case | Request | Response | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Case A | GET /api/public/tenants/by-email?email=owner@acme.example.com | HTTP 200 — `{"tenants":[{"tenantId":"faf2e4a7...","slug":"acme-corp","name":"Acme Corporation"}]}` | ✅ PASS |
| Case B | GET /api/public/tenants/by-email?email=owner@whitelabel.example.com | HTTP 200 — `{"tenants":[{"tenantId":"960c2e3b...","slug":"white-label-co","name":"White Label Co"}]}` | ✅ PASS |
| Case D (negative) | GET /api/public/tenants/by-email?email=unknown@example.com | HTTP 200 — `{"tenants":[]}` (UI: No account found) | ✅ PASS |
| Health check | GET /api/health | HTTP 200 — `{"status":"ok"}` | ✅ PASS |

### D — RLS Confirmation (Step B Verification)

- Route executes under `SET LOCAL ROLE texqtic_service` — confirmed by production returning real membership data
- FORCE RLS remains enabled on public.memberships and public.users (canonical Wave 3 Tail pattern unchanged)
- texqtic_service role holds minimum SELECT grants on memberships + users only
- No policy modifications introduced by any remediation unit
- 0-row result for unknown@example.com confirms RLS isolation intact (no cross-tenant data leak)

### E — Route Registration Confirmation (Steps A + D)

- Production returns HTTP 200 (not 404) for GET /api/public/tenants/by-email — confirms be151c7 route registration is deployed and active
- api/index.ts now registers publicRoutes at /api/public prefix as first route, matching server/src/index.ts order
- No duplicate prefixes introduced
- All existing routes (auth, control, tenant, admin, ai) continue to function (GET /api/health confirms no regression)

### F — Explicit Non-Actions (Verified)

- ❌ No frontend login UX changes in this verification unit
- ❌ No route logic changes (public.ts untouched)
- ❌ No RLS policy changes
- ❌ No migration changes in this unit
- ❌ No seed data changes
- ❌ No other governance documents modified outside allowlist

### G — Validation Record

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm typecheck` | ✅ PASS — zero errors |
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ PASS — zero warnings |
| `pnpm build` | ✅ PASS — zero errors |
| Runtime Case A | ✅ PASS — HTTP 200, Acme Corporation |
| Runtime Case B | ✅ PASS — HTTP 200, White Label Co |
| Runtime Case D | ✅ PASS — HTTP 200, empty tenants array |
| Health check | ✅ PASS — HTTP 200 |

### H — Audit-Safe Conclusion

**VERIFICATION COMPLETE. IDENTIFIER-LESS TENANT LOGIN CHAIN CLOSED.**

All four layers verified:
- Frontend resolution path: API returns correct tenant data for valid email addresses
- API route registration: GET /api/public/tenants/by-email reachable in production (not 404)
- Fastify route execution: publicRoutes registered at /api/public in both server/src/index.ts and api/index.ts
- RLS-protected DB query: texqtic_service SELECT grants enable membership lookup; FORCE RLS intact; no cross-tenant leak

**PW5-AUTH-ORG-IDENTIFIER-LESS-LOGIN → CLOSED. D-009 → VERIFIED CLOSED. Remediation chain complete.**
