# TEXQTIC PLATFORM DOCTRINE v1.2

> ℹ️ HISTORICAL DOCTRINE — READ-ONLY CONTEXT, NOT EXECUTABLE

**The Operating System for Verified Global Trade**

**Status:** LOCKED (Implementation-Binding)

---

## 0. Preamble: Why v1.2 Exists

TexQtic v1.1 defines what must be true for trust-based textile commerce to function. **v1.2 defines what happens when it fails.**

All complex socio-technical systems fail. Platforms collapse not because failure occurs, but because failure is undefined, unmanaged, or denied.

This version encodes explicit governance authority, failure-mode classification, escalation paths, and kill-switches so that:

- Failure is observable
- Authority is unambiguous
- Damage is containable
- Recovery is possible

---

## 1. Governance Authority Model

### 1.1 Doctrine Supremacy

The TexQtic Platform Doctrine supersedes product roadmaps, commercial agreements, partner demands, and short-term revenue incentives.

**If an action violates doctrine, it is invalid regardless of business justification.**

### 1.2 Control Plane Sovereignty

TexQtic retains irrevocable authority over the **Control Plane**, which is isolated from tenant workloads to prevent noisy-neighbor cascades and to limit the radius of security and compliance failures.

The Control Plane includes:

- Verification logic
- Risk scoring systems
- Compliance enforcement
- Dispute and arbitration mechanisms

**Tenants may not bypass, fork, or override Control Plane functions.**

### 1.3 Governance Bodies and the Maker–Checker Pattern

Governance is executed through three bodies. For all high-stakes actions (Escalation Level 2 or higher), TexQtic enforces the **Maker–Checker principle**: no single individual may unilaterally activate a platform-wide kill-switch, permanent ban, or irreversible sanction.

The governance bodies are:

1. **Doctrine Council** – Owns doctrine interpretation, amendment, and final authority
2. **Risk & Compliance Authority** – Executes enforcement actions and sanctions
3. **System Integrity Function** – Monitors technical, data, and AI system health

**Authority flows downward. Appeals flow upward. Emergency action precedes review.**

---

## 2. Failure Mode Taxonomy

TexQtic formally classifies failure to ensure appropriate containment and response.

### 2.1 Technical Failure

Includes:

- Data corruption
- Event loss or duplication
- Inconsistent traceability graphs
- AI inference or pipeline degradation

Mitigation mechanisms include **Infrastructure Pods** (isolated clusters), circuit breakers, and fail-closed defaults to ensure a failure in one tenant environment cannot halt the global engine.

**Primary risk:** False trust signals.

### 2.2 Regulatory Failure

Includes:

- Inability to generate or reproduce Digital Product Passport (DPP) artifacts
- Conflicting jurisdictional requirements
- Regulatory reinterpretation events

**Primary risk:** Platform-wide liability.

### 2.3 Market and Behavioral Failure

Includes:

- Liquidity collapse
- Systematic circumvention
- Collusive certification fraud
- Repeated dispute abuse

**Primary risk:** Integrity decay and re-emergence of Supply Chain Ghosts.

---

## 3. Escalation Levels and the Morgue

TexQtic enforces a four-tier escalation model. Any event reaching Level 1 or higher requires a blameless post-mortem recorded in **The Morgue**—an immutable repository of failure context, impact analysis, and remediation actions to ensure institutional learning.

- **Level 0 – Normal Operations:** All systems within thresholds
- **Level 1 – Localized Anomaly:** Human review required
- **Level 2 – Systemic Risk:** Feature throttling and mandatory verification expansion
- **Level 3 – Existential Threat:** Kill-switch activation

---

## 4. Kill-Switch Doctrine

### 4.1 Definition and States

Kill-switches are **governance tools, not panic buttons**. They are implemented as graduated states rather than binary shutdowns.

Defined states include:

- **Read-Only Mode** – Data and insights remain visible; new transactions and state-changing actions are frozen
- **Approval-Only Mode** – All autonomous actions (AI or automated systems) are suspended; every output requires explicit Checker authorization

### 4.2 Kill-Switch Categories

- **Transaction Kill-Switch** – Halts new trade execution
- **Certification Kill-Switch** – Suspends acceptance or issuance of verification artifacts
- **AI Kill-Switch** – Freezes automated decision-making and enforcement
- **Tenant Kill-Switch** – Isolates or suspends a tenant
- **Jurisdiction Kill-Switch** – Restricts activity in a defined geography

---

## 5. Human vs AI Authority Model

### 5.1 Human Authority

Humans:

- Bear legal and regulatory liability
- Interpret doctrine and regulation
- Authorize irreversible actions
- Resolve disputes and appeals

Human decisions are mandatory for:

- High-stakes contracts
- Kill-switch activation
- Permanent sanctions
- Regulatory interpretation shifts

### 5.2 AI Authority

AI systems:

- Detect anomalies
- Generate risk scores
- Recommend actions
- Enforce predefined guardrails

AI systems may not:

- Create compliance artifacts
- Assert legal truth
- Override contracts
- Act as certifying authorities

**AI authority is conditional, reversible, and always subordinate to human accountability.**

### 5.3 Explainability and Labeling

All AI-generated outputs must be clearly labeled. Any AI-driven risk score or recommendation must include a human-readable audit trail explaining the factors used, satisfying explainability requirements.

### 5.4 Drift Detection and AI Kill-Switch

AI systems are continuously monitored for confidence degradation, outcome divergence, and override frequency spikes. Drift beyond defined thresholds automatically escalates to Level 2 and triggers an **AI Kill-Switch**, placing the system into human-only mode.

---

## 6. Sanctions and Offboarding

### 6.1 Graduated Sanctions and Risk Decay

Sanctions escalate progressively:

1. Increased friction
2. Listing suppression
3. Feature restriction
4. Suspension
5. Permanent removal

Except for non-reversible violations, TexQtic applies the **Risk Decay principle**: sustained, verified compliance reduces risk scores over time.

### 6.2 Non-Reversibility

The following result in permanent bans:

- Proven certification fraud
- Repeated regulatory evasion
- Intentional system gaming

Records are stored in a tamper-resistant **Bad Actor pool** to prevent re-entry.

---

## 7. Doctrine Drift Detection

TexQtic continuously monitors for doctrine drift through feature usage patterns, exception rates, and revenue composition.

**Critical signal:** if the platform derives more revenue from bypass mechanisms than from compliance and verification services, doctrine drift has occurred and Doctrine Council intervention is mandatory.

---

## 8. Emergency Override and Regulatory Supremacy

In any conflict between TexQtic policy and regulatory mandate, **regulation supersedes doctrine**.

Forced-labor flags, government orders, or regulator notifications trigger immediate transaction freezes for affected entities or goods.

---

## 9. Sunsetting Rules

### 9.1 Governance Action

Sunsetting features, partners, or markets is a governance action, not a product failure.

### 9.2 Data Portability Guarantee

During any sunsetting event, tenants are guaranteed **data portability**. Verified traceability history and compliance records must be exportable in industry-standard, DPP-compatible formats.

---

## 10. Final Governance Principle

**TexQtic survives by choosing containment over continuity, integrity over growth, and governance over convenience.**
